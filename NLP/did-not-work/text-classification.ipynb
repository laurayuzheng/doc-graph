around the world. to meet the increasing demand for accurate\\npredictions for air pollutions, we proposed a deep inferential spatial-temporal\\nnetwork to deal with the complicated non-linear spatial and temporal\\ncorrelations. we forecast three air pollutants (i.e., pm2.5, pm10 and o3) of\\nmonitoring stations over the next 48 hours, using a hybrid deep learning model\\nconsists of inferential predictor (inference for regions without air pollution\\nreadings), spatial predictor (capturing spatial correlations using cnn) and\\ntemporal predictor (capturing temporal relationship using sequence-to-sequence\\nmodel with simplified attention mechanism). our proposed model considers\\nhistorical air pollution records and historical meteorological data. we\\nevaluate our model on a large-scale dataset containing air pollution records of\\n35 monitoring stations and grid meteorological data in beijing, china. our\\nmodel outperforms other state-of-art methods in terms of smape

this study, we unlock this hidden value behind user\\nreviews to understand the various dimensions along which users rate products.\\nwe learn a set of users that represent each of these dimensions and use their\\nratings to predict product ratings. specifically, we work with restaurant\\nreviews to identify users whose ratings are influenced by dimensions like\\n'service', 'atmosphere' etc. in order to predict restaurant ratings and\\nunderstand the variation in rating behaviour across different cuisines. while\\nprevious approaches to obtaining product ratings require either a large number\\nof user ratings or a few review texts, we show that it is possible to predict\\nratings with few user ratings and no review text. our experiments show that our\\napproach outperforms other

(cso) is a major problem to be addressed by many\\ncities. understanding the behavior of sewer system through proper urban\\nhydrological models is an effective method of enhancing sewer system\\nmanagement. conventional deterministic methods, which heavily rely on physical\\nprinciples, is inappropriate for real-time purpose due to their expensive\\ncomputation. on the other hand, data-driven methods have gained huge interests,\\nbut most studies only focus on modeling a single component of the sewer system\\nand supply information at a very abstract level. in this paper, we proposed the\\ndeepcso model, which aims at forecasting cso events from multiple cso\\nstructures simultaneously in near real time at a citywide level. the proposed\\nmodel provided an intermediate methodology that combines the flexibility of\\ndata-driven methods and the rich information contained in deterministic methods\\nwhile avoiding the drawbacks of these two methods. a comparison of the

paper entropy based methods are compared and used to measure\\nstructural diversity of an ensemble of 21 classifiers. this measure is mostly\\napplied in ecology, whereby species counts are used as a measure of diversity.\\nthe measures used were shannon entropy, simpsons and the berger parker\\ndiversity indexes. as the diversity indexes increased so did the accuracy of\\nthe ensemble. an ensemble dominated by classifiers with the same structure\\nproduced poor accuracy. uncertainty rule from information theory was also used\\nto further define diversity. genetic algorithms were used

accurate prediction of rainfall rates\\n  the present work is aimed to examine the potential of advanced machine\\nlearning strategies to predict the monthly rainfall (precipitation) for the\\nindus basin, using climatological variables such as air temperature,\\ngeo-potential height, relative humidity and elevation. in this work, the focus\\nis on thirteen geographical locations, called index points, within the basin.\\narguably, not all of the hydrological components are relevant to the\\nprecipitation rate, and therefore, need to be filtered out, leading to a\\nlower-dimensional feature space. towards this goal, we adopted the gradient\\nboosting method to extract the most contributive features for precipitation\\nrate prediction. five state-of-the-art machine learning methods have then been\\ntrained where pearson correlation coefficient and mean absolute error have been\\nreported as the prediction performance criteria. the random forest regression\\nmodel outperformed the other regression models achieving the maximum pearson\\ncorrelation coefficient and minimum mean absolute error for most of the index\\npoints. our results suggest the relative humidity (for pressure

statistical downscaling\\n\\nclimate projections simulated by global climate models (gcms) are often used for assessing the impacts of climate change. however, the relatively coarse resolutions of gcm outputs often preclude their application to accurately assessing the effects of climate change on finer regional-scale phenomena. downscaling of climate variables from coarser to finer regional scales using statistical methods is often performed for regional climate projections. statistical downscaling (sd) is based on the understanding that the regional climate is influenced by two factors - the large-scale climatic state and the regional or local features. a transfer function approach of sd involves learning a regression model that relates these features (predictors) to a climatic variable of interest (predictand) based on the past observations. however, often a single regression model is not sufficient to describe complex dynamic relationships between the predictors and predictand. we focus on the covariate selection part of the transfer function approach and propose a nonparametric bayesian mixture of sparse regression models based on dirichlet process (dp) for simultaneous clustering and discovery of covariates within the clusters while automatically finding the number of clusters. sparse linear models are parsimonious and hence more generalizable than non-sparse alternatives, and lend themselves to domain relevant interpretation. applications to synthetic data demonstrate the value of the new approach and preliminary results related to feature selection for statistical downscaling show that our method can lead to new insights.\\n)': False, 'contains(remote sensing image regression for heterogeneous change detection\\n  change detection in heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images is an\\nemerging topic in remote sensing. in this paper we propose a framework, based\\non image regression, to perform change detection in heterogeneous multitemporal\\nsatellite images, which has become a main topic in remote sensing. our method\\nlearns a transformation to map the first image to the domain of the other\\nimage, and vice versa. four regression methods are selected to carry out the\\ntransformation: gaussian processes, support vector machines, random forests,\\nand a recently proposed kernel regression method called homogeneous pixel\\ntransformation. to evaluate not only potentials and limitations of our\\nframework, but also the pros and cons of each regression method, we perform\\nexperiments on two data sets. the results indicates that random forests achieve\\ngood performance, are fast and robust to hyperparameters, whereas the\\nhomogeneous pixel transformation method can achieve better accuracy at the cost\\nof a higher complexity.\\n)': False, 'contains(multi-entity dependence learning with rich context via conditional\\n  variational auto-encoder\\n  multi-entity dependence learning (medl) explores conditional correlations\\namong multiple entities. the availability of rich contextual information\\nrequires a nimble learning scheme that tightly integrates with deep neural\\nnetworks and has the ability to capture correlation structures among\\nexponentially many outcomes. we propose medl_cvae, which encodes a conditional\\nmultivariate distribution as a generating process. as a result, the variational\\nlower bound of the joint likelihood can be optimized via a conditional\\nvariational auto-encoder and trained end-to-end on gpus. our medl_cvae was\\nmotivated by two real-world

satellite\\n  imagery using synthetic datasets\\n  satellites enable widespread, regional or global surveillance of volcanoes\\nand can provide the first indication of volcanic unrest or eruption. here we\\nconsider interferometric synthetic aperture radar (insar), which can be\\nemployed to detect surface deformation with a strong statistical link to\\neruption. the ability of machine learning to automatically identify signals of\\ninterest in these large insar datasets has already been demonstrated, but\\ndata-driven techniques, such as convolutional neutral networks (cnn) require\\nbalanced training datasets of positive and negative signals to effectively\\ndifferentiate between real deformation and noise. as only a small proportion of\\nvolcanoes are deforming and atmospheric noise is ubiquitous, the use of machine\\nlearning for detecting volcanic unrest is more challenging. in this paper, we\\naddress this problem using synthetic interferograms to train the alexnet. the\\nsynthetic interferograms are composed of 3 parts: 1) deformation patterns based\\non a monte carlo selection of parameters for analytic forward models, 2)\\nstratified atmospheric effects derived from weather models and 3) turbulent\\natmospheric effects based on statistical simulations of correlated noise. the\\nalexnet architecture trained with synthetic data outperforms that trained using\\nreal interferograms alone, based on classification accuracy and positive\\npredictive value (ppv). however, the models used to generate the synthetic\\nsignals are a simplification of the natural processes, so we retrain the cnn\\nwith a combined dataset consisting of synthetic models and selected real\\nexamples, achieving a final ppv of 82%. although applying atmospheric\\ncorrections to the entire dataset is computationally expensive, it is\\nrelatively simple to apply them to the small subset of positive results. this\\nfurther improves the detection performance without a significant increase in\\ncomputational burden.\\n)': False, 'contains(deep-learning inversion: a next generation seismic velocity-model\\n  building method\\n  seismic velocity is one of the most important parameters used in seismic\\nexploration. accurate velocity models are key prerequisites for reverse-time\\nmigration and other high-resolution seismic imaging techniques. such velocity\\ninformation has traditionally been derived by tomography or full-waveform\\ninversion (fwi), which are time consuming and computationally expensive, and\\nthey rely heavily on human interaction and quality control. we investigate a\\nnovel method based on the supervised deep fully convolutional neural network\\n(fcn) for velocity-model building (vmb) directly from raw seismograms. unlike\\nthe conventional inversion method based on physical models, the supervised\\ndeep-learning methods are based on big-data training rather than\\nprior-knowledge assumptions. during the training stage, the network establishes\\na nonlinear projection from the multi-shot seismic data to the corresponding\\nvelocity models. during the prediction stage, the trained network can be used\\nto estimate the velocity models from the new input seismic data. one key\\ncharacteristic of the deep-learning method is that it can automatically extract\\nmulti-layer useful features without the need for human-curated activities and\\ninitial velocity setup. the data-driven method usually requires more time\\nduring the training stage, and actual predictions take less time, with only\\nseconds needed. therefore, the computational time of geophysical inversions,\\nincluding real-time inversions, can be dramatically reduced once a good\\ngeneralized network is built. by using numerical experiments on synthetic\\nmodels, the promising performances of our proposed method are shown in\\ncomparison with conventional fwi even when the input data are in more realistic\\nscenarios. discussions on the deep-learning methods, training dataset, lack of\\nlow frequencies, and advantages and disadvantages of the new method are also\\nprovided.\\n)': False,

towards\\nthis goal, we first present the data collected from the seismometer that is\\ninstalled near the chimay\\\\'{o} geyser. the seismic signals collected at this\\nsite contain different types of noises such as daily temperature variations,\\nseasonal trends, animal movement near the geyser, and human activity. first, we\\nfilter the signals from these noises by combining the butterworth-highpass\\nfilter and an autoregressive method in a multi-level fashion. we show that by\\ncombining these filtering techniques, in a hierarchical fashion, leads to\\nreduction in the noise in the seismic data without removing the precursors and\\neruption event signals. we then use rf on the filtered data to classify the\\nstate of geyser into three classes -- remnant noise,

above and below tc, the neural network is able\\nto correctly classify data in a test set. finite-size scaling is capable\\nof systematically narrowing in on the thermodynamic value of tc\\nin a way analogous to measurements of the magnetization: a data\\ncollapse of the output layer (fig. 1b) leads to an estimate of the\\ncritical exponent ' 1.0 0.2, while a size scaling of the

of the model. we optimize the cnn in fig. 2d using\\nmonte carlo configurations from the ising gauge theory at t d 0\\nand t d 1. the cnn discriminates high-temperature from ground\\nstates with an

the\\ndetection of satisfied local energetic constraints of the theory, namely\\nwhether qi2p iz is either c1 (satisfied) or 1 (unsatisfied) on\\neach plaquette of the system (see the supplementary

seabed mapping techniques offering as well the important visual information. nevertheless, water refraction poses significant challenges on depth determination. till now, this problem has been addressed through customized image-based refraction correction algorithms or by modifying the collinearity equation. in this paper, in order to overcome the water refraction errors, we employ machine learning tools that are able to learn the systematic underestimation of the estimated depths. in the proposed approach, based on known depth observations from bathymetric lidar surveys, an svr model was developed able to estimate more accurately the real depths of point clouds derived from sfm-mvs procedures. experimental results over two test sites along with the performed quantitative validation indicated the high potential of the developed approach.\\n)': False, 'contains(ecological data analysis based on machine learning algorithms\\n  classification is an important supervised

networks for downscaling climate variability * and extremes\\n\\nthis paper presents an application of temporal neural networks for downscaling global climate models (gcms) output. because of computational constraints, gcms are usually run at coarse grid resolution (in the order of 100s of kilometres) and as a result they are inherently unable to present local sub-grid scale features and dynamics. consequently, outputs from these models cannot be used directly in many climate change impact studies. this research explored the issues of 'downscaling' the outputs of gcms using a temporal neural network (tnn) approach. the method is proposed for downscaling daily precipitation and temperature series for a region in northern quebec, canada. the downscaling models are developed and validated using large-scale predictor variables derived from the national center for environmental prediction (ncep) reanalysis data set. the performance of the temporal neural network downscaling model is also compared to a regression-based statistical downscaling model with emphasis on their ability in reproducing the observed climate variability and extremes. the downscaling results for the base period (1961-2000) suggest that the tnn is an efficient method for downscaling both daily precipitation as well as daily maximum and minimum temperature series. furthermore, the different model test results indicate that the tnn model mostly outperforms the statistical models for the downscaling of daily precipitation extremes and variability. q 2006 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. * this
