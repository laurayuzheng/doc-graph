        <p>-Geosciences is a field of great societal relevance that requires solutions to several urgent problems facing our humanity and the planet. As geosciences enters the era of big data, machine learning (ML)- that has been widely successful in commercial domains-offers immense potential to contribute to problems in geosciences. However, problems in geosciences have several unique challenges that are seldom found in traditional applications, requiring novel problem formulations and methodologies in machine learning. This article introduces researchers in the machine learning (ML) community to these challenges offered by geoscience problems and the opportunities that exist for advancing both machine learning and geosciences. We first highlight typical sources of geoscience data and describe their properties that make it challenging to use traditional machine learning techniques. We then describe some of the common categories of geoscience problems where machine learning can play a role, and discuss some of the existing efforts and promising directions for methodological development in machine learning. We conclude by discussing some of the emerging research themes in machine learning that are applicable across all problems in the geosciences, and the importance of a deep collaboration between machine learning and geosciences for synergistic advancements in both disciplines.</p>

s Momentous challenges facing our society require solutions
c to problems that are geophysical in nature [1], [2], [3], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ],
[ such as predicting impacts of climate change, measuring
1 air pollution, predicting increased risks to infrastructures
v by disasters such as hurricanes, modeling future availability
8 and consumption of water, food, and mineral resources, and
0 identifying factors responsible for earthquake, landslide,
7 flood, and volcanic eruption. The study of such problems
4 is at the confluence of several disciplines such as physics,
.0 geology, hydrology, chemistry, biology, ecology, and
anthro1 pology that aspire to understand the Earth system and its
1 various interacting components, collectively referred to as
17 the field of geosciences.
: As the deluge of big data continues to impact practically
iv every commercial and scientific domain, geosciences has
Xalso witnessed a major revolution from being a data-poor
r field to a data-rich field. This has been possible with the
a advent of better sensing technologies (e.g., remote sensing
satellites and deep sea drilling vessels), improvements in
computational resources for running large-scale simulations
of Earth system models, and Internet-based democratization
of data that has enabled the collection, storage, and
processing of data on crowd-sourced and distributed environments
such as cloud platforms. Most geoscience data sets are
publicly available and do not suffer from privacy issues that
have hindered adoption of data science methodologies in
areas such as health-care and cyber-security. The growing
availability of big geoscience data offers immense potential
for machine learning (ML)— that has revolutionized almost
all aspects of our living (e.g., commerce, transportation, and
entertainment)—to significantly contribute to geoscience
problems of great societal relevance.
      </p>
      <p>Given the variety of disciplines participating in
geoscience research and the diverse nature of questions being
investigated, the analysis of geoscience data has several
unique aspects that are strikingly different from standard
data science problems encountered in commercial domains.
For example, geoscience phenomena are governed by
physical laws and principles and involve objects and
relationships that often have amorphous boundaries and complex
latent variables. Challenges introduced by these
characteristics motivate the development of new problem
formulations and methodologies in machine learning that may be
broadly applicable to problems even outside the scope of
geosciences.</p>
      <p>
        Thus, there is a great opportunity for machine
learning researchers to closely collaborate with geoscientists
and cross-fertilize ideas across disciplines for advancing
the frontiers of machine learning as well as geosciences.
There are several communities working on this emerging
field of inter-disciplinary collaboration at the intersection
of geosciences and machine learning. These include, but
are not limited to, Climate Informatics: a community of
researchers conducting annual workshops to bridge problems
in climate science with methods from statistics, machine
learning, and data mining [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ]; Climate Change Expeditions:
a multi-institution multi-disciplinary collaboration funded
by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Expeditions in
Computing grant on “Understanding Climate Change: A
data-driven Approach” [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ]; and ESSI: a focus group of
the American Geophysical Union (AGU) on Earth &amp; Space
Sciences Informatics [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ]. More recently, NSF has funded a
research coordination network on Intelligent Systems for
Geosciences (IS-GEO) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ], with the intent of forging stronger
connections between the two communities. Furthermore,
a number of leading conferences in machine learning and
data mining such as Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining (KDD), IEEE International Conferene on Data Mining
(ICDM), SIAM International Conference on Data Mining
(SDM), and Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)
have included workshops or tutorials on topics related to
geosciences. The role of big data in geosciences has also been
recognized in recent perspective articles (e.g., [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ]) and
special issues of journals and magazines (e.g., [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ]).
      </p>
      <p>The purpose of this article is to introduce researchers
in the machine learning (ML) community to the
opportunities and challenges offered by geoscience problems. The
remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2
provides an overview of the types and origins of geoscience
data. Section 3 describes the challenges for machine learning
arising from both the underlying geoscience processes and
their data collection. Section 4 outlines important geoscience
problems where machine learning can yield major advances.
Section 5 discusses two cross-cutting themes of research in
machine learning that are generally applicable across all
areas of geoscience. Section 6 provides concluding remarks
by briefly discussing the best practices for collaboration
between machine learning researchers and geoscientists.

      <title>SOURCES OF GEOSCIENCE DATA</title>
      <p>
        The Earth and its major interacting components (e.g.,
lithosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere) are
complex dynamic systems [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ] in which the states of the
system perpetually keep changing in space and time, in
order to create a balance of mass and energy. The elements of
the Earth system (e.g., layers in oceans, ions in air, minerals
and grains in rock, and land covers on the ground) interact
with each other through complex and dynamic geoscience
processes (e.g., rain falling on Earth’s surface and
nourishing the biomass, sediments depositing on river banks and
changing river course, and magma erupting on sea floor
and forming islands).
      </p>
      <p>
        Data about these Earth system components and
geoscience processes can generally be obtained from two broad
categories of data sources: (a) observational data collected
via sensors in space, in the sea, or on the land, and (b)
simulation data from physics-based models of the Earth system.
We briefly describe both these categories of gesocience data
sources in the following. A detailed review of Earth science
data sets and their properties can be found in [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        ].
2.1
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>Geoscience Observations</title>
        <p>
          Information about the Earth system is collected via different
acquisition methods at varying scales of space and time
and for a variety of geoscience objectives. For example,
there is a nexus of Earth observing satellites in space that 2.2 Earth System Model Simulations
are tasked to monitor a number of geoscience variables A unique aspect of geoscience processes is that the
relasuch as surface temperature, humidity, optical reflectance, tionships among variables or the evolution of states of the
and chemical compositions of the atmosphere. There is a
growing body of space research organizations ranging from
public agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), European Space Agency (ESA),
and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to private
companies such as SpaceX that are together contributing to
the huge volume and variety of remote sensing data about
our Earth, many of which are publicly available (e.g., see
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
          ]). Remote sensing data provides a global picture of the
history of geoscience variables at fine spatial scales (1km
to 10m, and less) and at regular time intervals (monthly to
daily) for long periods, sometimes starting from the 1970s
(e.g., Landsat archives [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
          ]). For targeted studies in specific
geographic regions of interest, geoscience observations can
also be collected using sensors on-board flying devices such
as unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) or airplanes, e.g., to
detect and classify sources of methane (a powerful
greenhouse gas) being emitted into the atmosphere [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          Another major source of geoscience observations is the
collection of in-situ sensors placed on ground (e.g., weather
stations) or moving in the atmosphere (e.g., weather
balloons) or the ocean (e.g, ships and ocean buoys).
Sensorbased observations of geoscience processes are generally
available over non-uniform grids in space and at irregular
intervals of time, sometimes even over moving bodies such
as balloons, ships, or buoys. They constitute some of the
most reliable and direct sources of information about the
Earth’s weather and climate systems and are actively
maintained by public agencies such as the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
          ]. Sensor-based
measurements from rain and river gauges are also central
for understanding hydrological processes such as surface
water discharge [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
          ]. Land-based seismic sensors, Global
Positioning System (GPS)-enabled devices, and other
geophysical instruments also continuously measure the Earth’s
geological structure and processes [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
          ]. In addition, we also
have proxy measurements such as paleoclimatic records that
are sparsely available at a select few locations but go back
several thousands of years.
        </p>
        <p>Given the huge variety in the characteristics of data for
different geoscience processes, it is important to identify
the type and properties of a given geoscience data set to
make utmost use of relevant data analytics methodologies.</p>
        <p>For example, remote sensing data sets, that are commonly
available as rasters over regularly-spaced grid cells in space
and time, can be represented as geo-registered images over
individual time points or as time series data at individual
spatial locations. On the other hand, sensor measurements
from ships and ocean buoys can be represented as point
reference data (also termed as geostatistical data in the
spatial statistics literature) of continous spatio-temporal fields.</p>
        <p>
          Indeed, it is possible to convert one data type to another
and across different spatial and temporal resolutions using
simple interpolation methods or more advanced methods
based on physical understanding such as reanalysis
techniques [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
          ].
system are deeply grounded in physical laws and
principles, discovered by the scientific community over multiple
centuries of systematic research. For example, the motion of
water in the lithosphere, or of air in the atmosphere, is
governed by principles of fluid dynamics such as the Navier–
Stokes equation. Although such physics-based equations
can sometimes be solved in closed form for small-scale
experiments, most often it is difficult to obtain their exact
solutions for complex real-world systems encountered in the
geosceiences. However, the underlying physical principles
can still be used to simulate the evolution of the states of the
Earth system using numerical models referred to as
physicsbased models. Such models are the standard workhorse for
studying a majority of geoscience processes where the state
of the dynamical system can be time-stepped back in the
past or forward in the future using inputs such as initial
and boundary conditions or values of internal parameters
in physical equations. Physics-based models generate large
volumes of simulation data of different components of the
Earth system, which can be used in data-driven analyses.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are developed and maintained by a number of
centers constituting of diverse groups of researchers around
the world. For example, the World Climate Reserach
Programme (WCRP) develops and distributes simulations of
General Circulation Models (GCM) of climate variables such
as sea surface temperature and pressure under the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
          ]. Simulations of
terrestrial processes related to the lithosphere and biosphere
are produced by the Community Land Model (CLM) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
          ],
developed by a number of international agencies
collaborating with the National Center for Atmospheric Research
(NCAR).

      <title>GEOSCIENCE CHALLENGES</title>
      <p>There are several characteristics of geoscience applications
that limit the usefulness of traditional machine learning
algorithms for knowledge discovery. Firstly, there are some
inherent challenges arising from the nature of geoscience
processes. For example, geoscience objects generally have
amorphous boundaries in space and time that are not as
crisply defined as objects in other domains, such as users
on a social networking website, or products in a retail store.
Geoscience phenomena also have spatio-temporal structure,
are highly multi-variate, follow non-linear relationships
(e.g., chaotic), show non-stationary characteristics, and often
involve rare but interesting events. Secondly, apart from the
inherent challenges of geoscience processes, the procedures
used for collecting geoscience observations introduce more
challenges for machine learning. This includes the presence
of data at multiple resolutions of space and time, with
varying degrees of noise, incompleteness, and uncertainties.
Thirdly, for supervised learning approaches, there are
additional challenges due to the small sample size (e.g., small
number of historical years with adequate records) and lack
of gold-standard ground truth in geoscience applications.
In the following, we describe these three categories of
geoscience challenges, namely (a) inherent challenges of
geoscience processes, (b) geoscience data collection challenges,
and (c) paucity of samples and ground truth, in detail.</p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>3.1 Inherent Challenges of Geoscience Processes</title>
        <sec id="sec-3-1-1">
          <title>Property 1: Objects with Amorphous Boundaries</title>
          <p>
            Geoscience objects include waves, flows, and coherent
structures in all phases of matter. Hence, the form, structure,
and patterns of geoscience objects that can exist at
multiple scales in continuous spatio-temporal fields are much
more complex than those found in discrete spaces that
machine learning algorithms typically deal with, such as
items in market basket data. For example, eddies, storms
and hurricanes dynamically deform in complicated ways
from a purely object-oriented perspective. New techniques
to consider both the pattern and dynamical information of
coherent objects and their uncertainties are being developed
[
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
            ], [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
            ], but new methods for capturing other features of
geoscience objects, e.g., fluid segmentation and fluid feature
characterization, are needed.
          </p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-3-1-2">
          <title>Property 2: Spatiotemporal Structure</title>
          <p>Since almost every geoscience phenomena occurs in the
realm of space and time, geoscience observations are
generally auto-correlated in both space and time when observed
at appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions. For
example, a location that is covered by a certain land cover label
(e.g., forest, shrubland, urban) is generally surrounded by
locations that have similar land cover labels. Land cover
labels are also consistent along time, i.e., the label at a
certain time is related to the labels in its immediate temporal
vicinity. Furthermore, if the land cover at a certain location
changes (e.g., from forest to croplands), the change generally
persists for some temporal duration instead of switching
back and forth.</p>
          <p>
            Although spatio-temporal autocorrelation dictates
stronger connectivity among nearby observations in space
and time, geoscience processes can also show long-range
spatial dependencies. For example, a commonly studied
phenomenon in climate science is teleconnections [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
            ],
[
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
            ], where two distant regions in the world show strongly
coupled activity in climate variables such as temperature or
pressure. Geoscience processes can also show long-memory
characteristics in time, e.g., the effect of climate indices such
as the El Nin˜ o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Atlantic
Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) on global floods, droughts,
and forest fires [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
            ], [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>
            ].
          </p>
          <p>The inherent spatio-temporal structure of geoscience
data has several implications on machine learning methods.
This is because many of the widely used machine learning
methods are founded on the assumption that observed
variables are independent and identically distributed (i:i:d).
However, this assumption is routinely violated in
geoscience problems, where variables are structurally related
to each other in the context of space and time, unless there
is a discontinuity, such as a fault, across which
autocorrelation ceases to persist. Cognizance of the spatio-temporal
autocorrelation in geoscience data collected in continuous
media is crucial for the effective modeling of geophysical
phenomena.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-3-1-3">
          <title>Property 3: High Dimensionality</title>
          <p>
            The Earth system is incredibly complex, with a huge number
of potential variables, which may all impact each other,
and thus many of which may have to be considered
simultaneously [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>
            ]. For example, the robust and complete
detection of land cover changes, such as forest fires, requires
the analysis of multiple remote sensing variables, such as
vegetation indices and thermal anomaly signals. Capturing
the effects of these multiple variables at fine resolutions
of space and time renders geoscience data inherently high
dimensional, where the number of dimensions can easily
reach orders of millions.
          </p>
          <p>As an example, in order to study processes occurring
on the Earth’s surface, even a relatively coarse resolution
data set (e.g. at 2.5o spatial resolution) may easily result in
more than 10,000 spatial grid points, where every grid point
has multiple observations in time. Furthermore, geoscience
phenomena are not limited to the Earth’s surface, but extend
beneath the Earth’s surface (e.g., in the study of
groundwater, faults, or petroleum) and across multiple layers in
the atmosphere or the mantle, additionally increasing the
dimensionality of the data in 3D spatial resolutions. Hence,
there is a need to scale existing machine learning methods
to handle tens of thousands, or millions, of dimensions for
global analysis of geoscience phenomena.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-3-1-4">
          <title>Property 4: Heterogeneity in Space and Time</title>
          <p>An interesting characteristic of geoscience processes is their
degree of variability in space and time, leading to a rich
heterogeneity in geoscience data across space and time.
For example, due to the presence of varying geographies,
vegetation types, rock formations, and climatic conditions
in different regions of the Earth, the characteristics of
geoscience variables vary significantly from one location to the
other. Furthermore, the Earth system is not stationary in
time and goes through many cycles, ranging from seasonal
and decadal cycles to long-term geological changes (e.g.,
glaciation, polarity reversals) and even climate change
phenomena, that impact all local processes. This heterogeneity
of geoscience processes makes it difficult to study the joint
distribution of geoscience variables across all points in space
and time. Hence, it is difficult to train machine learning
models that have good performance across all regions in
space and across all time-steps. Instead, there is a need
to build local or regional models, each corresponding to a
homogeneous group of observations.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-3-1-5">
          <title>Property 5: Interest in Rare Phenomena</title>
          <p>
            In a number of geoscience problems, we are interested in
studying objects, processes, and events that occur
infrequently in space and time but have major impacts on our
society and the Earth’s ecosystem. For example, extreme
weather events such as cyclones, flash floods, and heat
waves can result in huge losses of human life and
property, thus making it vital to monitor them for adaptation
and mitigation requirements. These processes may relate
to emergent (or anomalous) states of the Earth system, or
other features of complex systems such as anomalous state
trajectories and basins of attractions [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>
            ]. As another
example, detecting rare changes in the Earth’s biosphere such as
deforestation, insect damage, and forest fires can be helpful
in assessing the impact of human actions and informing
decisions to promote ecosystem sustainability. Identifying
such rare classes of changes and events from geoscience
data and characterizing their behavior is challenging. This
is because we often have an inadequate number of data
samples from the rare class due to the skew (imbalance)
between the classes, making their modeling and
characterization difficult.

        <title>Geoscience Data Collection Challenges</title>
        <sec id="sec-3-2-1">
          <title>Property 6: Multi-resolution Data</title>
          <p>Geoscience data sets are often available via different sources
(e.g., satellite sensors, in-situ measurements and
modelbased simulations) and at varying spatial and temporal
resolutions. These data sets may exhibit varying
characteristics, such as sampling rate, accuracy, and uncertainty.
For example, in-situ sensors, such as buoys in the ocean
and hydrological and weather measuring stations, are often
irregularly spaced. As another example, collecting
highresolution data of ecosystem processes, such as forest fires,
may require using aerial imageries from planes flying over
the region of interest, which may need to be combined with
coarser resolution satellite imageries available at frequent
time intervals. The analysis of multi-resolution geoscience
data sets can help us characterize processes that occur at
varying scales of space and time. For example, processes
such as plate tectonics and gravity occur at a global scale,
while local processes include volcanism, earthquakes, and
landslides. To handle multi-resolution data, a common
approach is to build a bridge between data sets at disparate
scales (e.g., using interpolation techniques), so that they
can be represented at the same resolution. We also need to
develop algorithms that can identify patterns at multiple
resolutions without upsampling all the data sets to the
highest resolution.</p>

          <title>Data</title>
          <p>Many geoscience data sets (e.g., those collected by Earth
observing satellite sensors) are plagued with noise and
missing values. For example, sensors may temporarily fail
due to malfunctions or severe weather conditions,
resulting in missing data. Additionally, changes in measuring
equipment, e.g., replacing a faulty sensor or switching from
one satellite generation to the next, may change the
interpretation of sensor values over time, making it difficult to
deploy a consistent methodology of analysis across different
time periods. In many geoscience applications, the signal of
interest can be small in magnitude compared to the
magnitude of noise. Furthermore, many sensor properties can
increase noise, such as sensor interference, e.g., in the case
of remotely sensed land surface data, where atmospheric
(clouds and other aerosols) and surface (snow and ice)
interference are constantly encountered.</p>
          <p>
            Many geoscience variables cannot even be measured
directly, but can only be inferred from other observations
or model simulations. For example, one can use airborne
imaging spectrometers to detect sources of methane (e.g.,
pipeline leaks), an important greenhouse gas. These
instruments fly overhead surveys and map the ground-reflected
sunlight arriving at the sensor. Methane plumes can then
be identified from excess sunlight absorption [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
            ]. But to
determine the leak rate (flux) and the resulting greenhouse
gas impact, one must also know how fast the excess methane
mass is dispersing. This requires considering the influence
of air transport, which in turn requires steady-state physical
assumptions, morphology-based plume modeling, or direct
in-situ measurements of the wind speed. Even data
generated from model outputs have uncertainties because of our
imperfect knowledge of the initial and boundary conditions
of the system or the parametric forms of approximations
used in the model.

        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-3-2-4">
          <title>Property 8: Small sample size</title>
          <p>The number of samples in geoscience data sets is often
limited in both space and time. Factors that limit sample
size include history of data collection and the nature of
phenomenon being measured. For example, most satellite
products are only available since the 1970s, and when monthly
(yearly) processes are considered, this means that less than
600 (50) samples are available. Furthermore, there are many
events in geosciences that are important to monitor but
occur very infrequently, thus resulting in small sample sizes.
For example, a majority of land cover changes, landslide,
tsunami, and forest fire are rare events, and only occur for
short temporal durations mostly over small spatial regions.
With less than 80 years of reliable sensor-based data, only a
few dozens of rare events are available as training data.</p>
          <p>The limited spatial and temporal resolution of some
geoscience variables is also limited by the nature of observation
methodology. For example, paleo-climate data are derived
from coral, lake sediments (varves), tree rings, and deep
ice core samples, which are only available at a few places
around the Earth. Similarly, early records of precipitation
only exist in areas covered by land.</p>
          <p>This is in contrast to commercial applications involving
Internet-scale data, e.g., text mining or object recognition,
where large volumes of labeled or unlabeled data have been
one of the major factors behind the success of machine
learning methodologies such as deep learning. The limited
number of samples in geoscience applications along with
the large number of physical variables result in problems
that are under-constrained in nature, requiring novel
machine learning advances for their robust analyses.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-3-2-5">
          <title>Property 9: Paucity of Ground Truth</title>
          <p>Even though many geoscience applications involve large
amounts of data, e.g., global observations of ecosystem
variables at high spatial and temporal resolutions using Earth
observing satellites, a common feature of geoscience
problems is the paucity of labeled samples with gold-standard
ground truth. This is because high-quality measurements of
several geoscience variables can only be taken by expensive
apparatus such as low-flying airplanes, or tedious and
timeconsuming operations such as field-based surveys, which
severely limit the collection of ground truth samples. Other
geoscience processes (e.g., subsurface flow of water) do not
have ground truth at all, since, due to complexity of the
system, the exact state of the system is never fully known.</p>
          <p>
            The paucity of representative training samples can result
in poor performance for many machine learning methods,
either due to underfitting where the model is too simple,
or due to overfitting where the model is overly complex
relative to the dimensionality of features and the limited
number of training samples. Hence, there is a need to
develop machine learning methods that can learn
parsimonious models even in the paucity of labeled data. Another
possibility is to construct synthetic data sets through
simulations [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>
            ] or perturbation that can be used for training [
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>
            ],
to make the most of the few observations.

      <title>GEOSCIENCE PROBLEMS AND ML DIRECTIONS</title>
      <p>Geoscientists constantly strive to develop better approaches
for modeling the current state of the Earth system (e.g., how
much methane is escaping into the atmosphere right now,
which parts of Earth are covered by what kind of biomass)
and its evolution, as well as the connections within and
between all of its subsystems (e.g., how does a warming
ocean affects specific ecosystems). This is aimed at
advancing our scientific understanding of geoscience processes.
This can also help in providing actionable information (e.g.,
extreme weather warnings) or informing policy decisions
that directly impact our society (e.g., adapting to climate
change and progressing towards sustainable lifestyles). The
boundaries between these goals often blur in practice, e.g.,
an improved tornado model may simultaneously lead to a
better science model as well as a more effective warning
system.</p>
      <p>Viewing from the lens of geosciences, many methods
from machine learning are a natural fit for the problems
encountered in geoscience applications. For example,
classification and pattern recognition methods are useful for
characterizing objects such as extreme weather events or
swarms of foreshocks or aftershocks (tremors preceding or
following an earthquake), estimating geoscience variables,
and producing long-term forecasts of the state of the Earth
system. As another example, approaches for mining
relationships and causal attribution can provide insights into
the inner workings of the Earth system and support policy
making. In the following, we briefly describe five broad
categories of geoscience problems, and discuss promising
machine learning directions and examples of some recent
successes that are relevant for each problem.
4.1</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>Characterizing Objects and Events</title>
        <p>Machine learning algorithms can help in characterizing
objects and events in geosciences that are critical for
understanding the Earth system. For example, we can analyze
patterns in geoscience data sets to detect climate events
such as cyclogenesis and tornadogenesis, and discover their
precursors for predicting them with long leads in time.
Analyzing spatial and temporal patterns in geoscience data can
also help in studying the formation and movement of
climate objects such as weather fronts, atmospheric rivers, and
ocean eddies, which are major drivers of vital geoscience
processes such as the transfer of precipitation, energy, and
nutrients in the atmosphere and ocean.</p>
        <p>
          While traditional approaches for characterizing
geoscience objects and events are primarily based on the use
of hand-coded features (e.g., ad-hoc rules on size and
shape constraints for finding ocean eddies [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>
          ]), machine
learning algorithms can enable their automated detection
from data with improved performance using pattern mining
techniques. However, in the presence of spatio-temporal
objects with amorphous boundaries and their associated
uncertainties [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
          ], there is a need to develop pattern mining
approaches that can account for the spatial and temporal
properties of geoscience data while characterizing objects
and events. One such approach has been successfully used
for finding spatio-temporal patterns in sea surface height
data [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>
          ], [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>
          ], resulting in the creation of a global
catalogue of mesoscale ocean eddies [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>
          ]. Another approach for
finding anomalous objects buried under the surface of the
Earth (e.g., land mines) from radar images was explored
in [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>
          ], using unsupervised techniques that can work with
mediums of varying properties. The use of topic models has
also been explored for finding extreme events from climate
time series data [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>
          ].

      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>Estimating Geoscience Variables from Observa</title>
        <p>There is a great opportunity for machine learning
methods to infer critical geoscience variables that are difficult
to monitor directly, e.g., methane concentrations in air or
groundwater seepage in soil, using information about other
variables collected via satellites and ground-based sensors,
or simulated using Earth system models. For example,
supervised machine learning algorithms can be used to
analyze remote sensing data and produce estimates of
ecosystem variables such as forest cover, health of vegetation,
water quality, and surface water availability, at fine spatial
scales and at regular intervals of time. Such estimates of
geoscience variables can help in informing management
decisions and enabling scientific studies of changes occurring
on the Earth’s surface.</p>
        <p>
          A major challenge in the use of supervised learning
approaches for estimating geoscience variables is the
heterogeneity in the characteristics of variables across space and
time. One way to address this challenge of heterogeneity is
to explore multi-task learning frameworks [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>
          ], [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>
          ], where
the learning of a model at every homogeneous partition of
the data is considered as a separate task, and the models
are shared across similar tasks to regularize their learning
and avoid the problem of overfitting, especially when some
tasks suffer from paucity of training samples. An example
of a multi-task learning based approach for handling
heterogeneity can be found in a recent work in [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>
          ], where the
learning of a forest cover model at every vegetation type
(discovered by clustering vegetation time-series at locations)
was treated as a separate task, and the similarity among
vegetation types (extracted using hierarchical clustering
techniques) was used to share the learning at related tasks.
Figure 1 shows the improvement in prediction performance
of forest cover in Brazil using a multi-task learning
approach. A detailed review of promising machine learning
advances such as multi-task learning, multi-view learning,
and multi-instance learning for addressing the challenges in
supervised monitoring of land cover changes from remote
sensing data is presented in [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          To address the non-stationary nature of climate data,
online learning algorithms have been developed to combine
the ensemble outputs of expert predictors (climate models)
and produce robust estimates of climate variables such as
temperature [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>
          ], [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>
          ]. In this line of work, weights over
experts were updated in an adaptive way across space and
time, to capture the right structure of non-stationarity in the
data. This was shown to significantly outperform the the
baseline technique used in climate science, which is the
nonadaptive mean over experts (multi-model mean). Another
approach for addressing non-stationarity was explored in
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>
          ], where a Bayesian mixture of models was learned for
downscaling climate variables, where a different model was
learned for every homogeneous cluster of locations in space.
In a recent work, adaptive ensemble learning methods [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>
          ],
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>
          ], in conjunction with physics-based label refinement
techniques [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>
          ], have been developed to address the
challenge of heterogeneity and poor data quality for mapping
the dynamics of surface water bodies using remote sensing
data [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>
          ]. This has enabled the creation of a global surface
water monitoring system (publicly available at [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>
          ]) that is
able to discover a variety of changes in surface water such
as shrinking lakes due to droughts, melting glacial lakes,
migrating river courses, and constructions of new dams and
reservoirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another challenge in the supervised estimation of
geoscience variables is the small sample size and paucity of
ground-truth labels. Methods for handling the problem of
high dimensions and small sample sizes have been explored
in [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>
          ], where sparsity-inducing regularizers such as sparse
group Lasso were developed to model the domain
characteristics of climate variables. To address the paucity of
labels, novel learning frameworks such as semi-supervised
learning, that leverages the structure in the unlabeled data
for improving classification performance [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>
          ], and active
learning, where an expert annotator is actively involved
in the process of model building [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>
          ], have huge potential
for improving the state-of-the-art in estimation problems
encountered in gesocience applications [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>
          ], [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>
          ]. In a recent
line of work, attempts to build a machine learning model to
predict forest fires in the tropics using remote sensing data
led to a novel methodology for building predictive models
for rare phenomena [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>
          ] that can be applied in any setting
where it is not possible to get high quality labeled data even
for a small set of samples, but poor quality labels (perhaps
in the form of heuristics) are available for all samples.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to supervised learning approaches, given
the plentiful availability of unlabeled data in geoscience
applications such as remote sensing, there are several
opportunities for unsupervised learning methods in estimating
geoscience variables. For example, changes in time series
of vegetation data, collected by satellite instruments on
fixed time intervals at every spatial location on the Earth’s
surface, have been extensively studied using unsupervised
learning approaches for mapping land cover changes such
as deforestation, insect damage, farm conversions, and
forest fires [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>
          ], [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>

processes using state-based dynamical systems where the
current state of the system is influenced by previous states
and observations using physical laws and principles. From a
machine learning perspective, this can be treated as a
timeseries regression problem where the future conditions of a
geoscience variable has to be predicted based on present and
past conditions. Some of the existing methods for time-series
forecasting include exponential smoothing techniques [

Machine learning methods for forecasting climate variables
using the spatial and temporal structure of geoscience data

        </p>
        <p>
          A key challenge in predicting the long-term trends of
geoscience variables is to develop approaches that can
represent and propagate prediction uncertainties, which is
particularly difficult due to the high-dimensional and
nonstationary nature of geoscience processes [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">71</xref>
          ], [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">72</xref>
          ]. In the
climate scenario, there is limited long-term predictability
at fine spatial scales necessary for implementing policy
decisions. Some advances have been made in downscaling
future projections to high spatial resolutions, e.g., using
physics-based Markov Chain and Random Field models
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref>
          ], but much remains to be done. Further, the data is
sparse, and the uncertainty distributions remain poorly
sampled [

          ], [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref>
          ]. The heavy-tailed nature of extreme
events such as cyclones and floods further exacerbates the
challenges in producing their long-term forecasts. In a recent
work [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref>
          ], regression models based on extreme value theory
have been developed to automatically discover sparse
temporal dependencies and make predictions in multivariate
extreme value time series. Other approaches for predicting
extreme weather events such as abnormally high rainfall,
floods, and tornadoes using climate data have also been
explored in [

variables can benefit from recent advances in machine
learning such as transfer learning [

trained on a present task (with sufficient number of training

        <title>Mining Relationships in Geoscience Data</title>
        <p>
          An important problem in geoscience applications is to
understand how different physical processes are related to
each other, e.g., periodic changes in the sea surface
temperature over eastern Pacific Ocean—also known as the El Ni
n˜oSouthern Oscillation (ENSO)—and their impact on several
terrestrial events such as floods, droughts, and forest fires
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
          ], [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>
          ]. Identifying such relationships from geoscience
data can help us capture vital signs of the Earth system
and advance our understanding of geoscience processes. A
common class of relationships that is studied in the climate
domain is teleconnections, which are pairs of distant regions
that are highly correlated in climate variables such as sea
level pressure or temperature. One of the widely-studied
category of teleconnections is dipoles [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
          ], [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">80</xref>
          ], which are
pairs of regions with strong negative correlations (e.g., the
ENSO phenomena). There is a huge potential in
discovering such relationships using data-driven approaches, that
can sift through vast volumes of observational and
modelbased geoscience data and discover interesting patterns
corresponding to geoscience relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the first attempts in discovering relationships
from climate data is a seminal work by Steinbach et al.
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref81">81</xref>
          ]. In this work, graph-based representations of global
climate data were constructed in which each node
represents a location on the Earth and an edge represents
the similarity (e.g., correlation) between the climate time
series observed at a pair of locations. Dipoles and other
higher-order relationships (e.g., tripoles involving triplets of
regions) could then be discovered from climate graphs using
clustering and pattern mining approaches. Another family
of approaches for mining relationships in climate science is
based on representing climate graphs as complex networks
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref82">82</xref>
          ]. This includes approaches for examining the structure
of the climate system [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref83">83</xref>
          ], studying hurricane activity [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">84</xref>
          ],
and finding communities in climate networks [

          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          Formidable challenges arise in the problem of
relationship mining due to the enormous search space of candidate
relationships, and the need to simultaneously extract
spatiotemporal objects, their relationships, and their dynamics,
from noisy and incomplete geoscience data. Hence, there

          Discovering cause-effect relationships is an important task
in the geosciences, closely related to the task of learning
relationships in geoscience data, discussed in Subsection
4.4. The two primary frameworks for analyzing cause-effect
relationships are based on the concept of Granger causality
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref91">91</xref>
          ], which defines causality in terms of predictability, and

In this section, we discuss two emerging themes of machine of deep learning in commercial domains, a key challenge
learning research that are generally applicable across all in geoscience problems is the paucity of labeled samples,
thus limiting the effectiveness of traditional deep learning
methods. There is thus a need to develop novel deep
learning frameworks for geoscience problems, that can overcome
the paucity of labeled data, for example, by using
domainspecific information of physical processes.
Given the complexity of problems in geoscience applications
and the limitations of current methodological frameworks
in geosciences (e.g., see recent debate papers in hydrology
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref108">108</xref>
          ], [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref109">109</xref>
          ], [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref110">110</xref>
          ]), neither a data-only, nor a physics-only,
approach can be considered sufficient for knowledge
discovery. Instead, there is an opportunity to pursue an alternate
paradigm of research that explores the continuum between
physics (or theory)-based models and data science methods
by deeply integrating scientific knowledge in data science
methodologies, termed as the paradigm of theory-guided
data science [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref111">111</xref>
          ]. For example, scientific consistency can
be weaved in the learning objectives of predictive learning
algorithms, such that the learned models are not only less
complex and show low training errors, but are also
consistent with existing scientific knowledge. This can help in
pruning large spaces of models that are inconsistent with
our physical understanding, thus reducing the variance
without likely affecting the bias. Hence, by anchoring
machine learning frameworks with scientific knowledge, the
learned models can stand a better chance against overfitting,
especially when training data are scarce. For example, a
recent work explored the use of physics-guided loss functions
for tracking objects in sequences of images [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">112</xref>
          ], where
elementary knowledge of laws of motion was solely used
for constraining outputs and learning models, without the
help of training labels. Another motivation for learning
physically consistent models and solutions is that they can
be easily understood by domain scientists and ingested
in existing knowledge bases, thus translating to scientific
advancements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The paradigm of theory-guided data science is beginning
to be pursued in several scientific disciplines ranging from
material science to hydrology, turbulence modeling, and
biomedicine. A recent paper [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref111">111</xref>
          ] builds the foundation
of this paradigm and illustrates several ways of
blending scientific knowledge with data science models, using
emerging applications from diverse domains. There is a
great opportunity for exploring similar lines of research in
geoscience applications, where machine learning methods
can play a major role in accelerating knowledge discovery
by automatically learning patterns and models from the
data, but without ignoring the wealth of knowledge
accumulated in physics-based model representations of
geoscience processes [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75">75</xref>
          ]. This can complement existing efforts
in the geosciences on integrating data in physics-based
models, e.g., in model calibration, where parametric forms
of approximations used in models are learned from the data
by solving inverse problems, or in data assimilation, where
the sequence of state transitions of the system are informed
by measurements of observed variables wherever available

      <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
      <p>The Earth System is a place of great scientific interest that
impacts every aspect of life on this planet and beyond.
The survey of challenges, problems, and promising machine
learning directions provided in this article is clearly not
exhaustive, but it illustrates the great emerging possibilities
of future machine learning research in this important area.</p>
      <p>
        Successful application of machine learning techniques in
the geosciences is generally driven by a science question
arising in the geosciences, and the best recipe for success
tends to be for a machine learning researcher to
collaborate very closely with a geoscientist during all phases of
research. That is because the geoscientists are in a better
position to understand which science question is novel and
important, which variables and data set to use to answer
that question, the strengths and weaknesses inherent in
the data collection process that yielded the data set, and
which pre-processing steps to apply, such as smoothing or
removing seasonal cycles. Likewise, the machine learning
researchers are better placed to decide which data analysis
methods are available and appropriate for the data, the
strengths and weaknesses of those methods, and what they
can realistically achieve. Interpretability is also an important
end goal in geosciences because if we can understand the
basic reasoning behind the patterns, models, or relationships
extracted from the data, they can be used as building blocks
in scientific knowledge discovery. Hence, choosing methods
that are inherently transparent are generally preferred in
most geoscience applications. Further, the end results of a
study need to be translated into geoscience language so
that it can be related back to the original science questions.
Hence, frequent communication between the researchers
avoids long detours and ensures that the outcome of the
analysis is indeed rewarding for both machine learning
researchers and geoscientists [
