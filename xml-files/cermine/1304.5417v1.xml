        presents a comprehensive analysis of complex Gaussian
models, along with the connection between the class of
complex covariance matrices and the Wishart
distribution. Indeed, the complex scaled Wishart distribution is
widely adopted as a statistical model for multilook full
polarimetric data [

      </p>
      <p>PolSAR sensors record intensity and relative phase
data which can be presented as complex scattering
matrices. In principle, these matrices consist of four complex
elements SHH; SHV; SVH; and SVV, where H and V refer
to the horizontal and vertical wave polarization states,</p>

Kullback-Leibler, Re´nyi (of order ), Bhattacharyya,
and Hellinger distances between scaled complex Wishart
distributions in their most general form and in important
particular cases. Frery et al [15] obtained analytical
expressions for these distances, as well as for the 2
distance, and they show that the last one is numerically

      <p>Considering the hypothesis test methodology proposed
by Salicru´ et al. [17], the derived distances are multiplied
by a coefficient which involves the sizes of two samples
of PolSAR images. The asymptotic and finite-sample

      <p>In order to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, L
independent and identically distributed (iid) samples are
usually averaged in order to form the L-looks covariance

      <p>In order to quantify the sensitivity of the distances,
we perform Monte Carlo experiments in several possible
scenarios. We illustrate the behavior of these distances
and their associated hypothesis tests with actual data.</p>
      <p>This paper unfolds as follows. Section II presents the
scaled and the relaxed complex Wishart distributions
and estimators for their parameters. Section III recalls
the background of stochastic dissimilarities. Section IV
presents the analytic expressions of distances between
Wishart models, with a new way to derive the Bartlett
and the revised Wishart distances. Section V illustrates
the application of these distances in PolSAR image
discrimination. Section VI concludes the paper.</p>

the aforementioned hypotheses, Z follows a scaled

removed the restriction L p. The resulting distribution
has the same form as in (2) and is termed the relaxed
Wishart distribution denoted as WR( ; n). This model
accepts variations of n along the image, and will be
assumed henceforth.</p>

        Well-known divergences arise after adequate choices

Bhattacharyya [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">34</xref>
        ], and (iv) Hellinger [14]. As the
triangular inequality is not necessarily satisfied, not every
divergence measure is a metric [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">35</xref>
        ]. Additionally, the
symmetry property is not followed by some of these
divergence measures. Nevertheless, such tools are
mathematically appropriate for comparing the distribution of
random variables [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">36</xref>
        ]. The following expression has
been suggested as a possible solution for this issue [

a “divergence” is any non-negative function between

is also symmetric, it is called a “distance”. Finally, we Dh(X; Y ) + Dh(Y ; X)

      <p>IV. ANALYTIC EXPRESSIONS, SENSITIVITY,
INEQUALITIES, AND FINITE SAMPLE SIZE BEHAVIOR</p>
      <p>In the following, analytic expressions for the
stochastic distances dKL, dR, dB, and dH between two
relaxed complex Wishart distributions are derived
(Section IV-A). We examine the special cases in terms of
the parameter values: (i) 1 6= 2 and n1 6= n2, which
correspond to the most general case, (ii) same equivalent
number of looks n1 = n2 = n and different covariance
matrices 1 6= 2, and (iii) same covariance matrix</p>
      <p>1 = 2 and different equivalent number of looks
n1 6= n2. Case (ii) is likely to be the most frequently
used in practice since it allows the comparison of two
possibly different areas from the same image. Case (iii)
allows the assessment of a change in distribution due
only to multilook processing on the same area.</p>
      <p>The sensitivity of the tests to variations of parameters
is qualitatively assessed and discussed in Section IV-B.</p>
      <p>
        In Section IV-C we derive inequalities which 1 and
2 must obey. These inequalities lead to the Bartlett and
revised Wishart distances in a different and simple way
when compared to a well-known method available in
literature [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">42</xref>

invariance with respect to .

      <p>Now we examine the behavior of the statistics
presented in Lemma 1 with respect to parameter variations,
i.e., under the alternative hypotheses. These statistics
are directly comparable since they all have the same
asymptotic distribution; we used N1 = N2 = 100. Two
simple alternative hypotheses are illustrated: changes in
an entry in the diagonal of the covariance matrix, and
changes in the number of looks.</p>
      <p>Firstly, we assumed n = 8 looks, 1 =
( (360932); 8) and 2 = ( (x); 8), where
(10)
Since the covariance matrix is Hermitian, only the
upper triangle and the diagonal are displayed. The fixed
covariance matrix (360932) was previously analyzed
in [6] in PolSAR data of forested areas.</p>
      <p>Fig. 3(a) shows the statistics for x 2 [160000; 560000].
They present roughly the same behavior.</p>
      <p>Secondly, we considered fixed covariance
matrices with varying equivalent number of looks: 1 =
( (360932); 8) and 2 = ( (360932); m), for 3 m
13. Fig. 3(b) shows the statistics. It is noticeable that the
test statistics are steeper to the left of the minimum.
The number of looks, being a shape parameter, alters
the distribution in a nonlinear fashion. Such change
is perceived visually and by distance measures, and
it is more intense for low values of the parameter.

for the covariance matrix under the complex Wishart
model using inequalities relating the sought parameters.
In the following we derive new inequalities for this
model. Due to the major role of the covariance matrix
in polarimetry [13], we limit our analysis to inequalities
that depend on .
      </p>
      <p>Case (ii) described in previous subsections paved the
way for the new inequalities. The following results stem
from the nonnegativity of the four distances:
respectively. Fixing = 1=2 in (12), we obtain (14)
directly; taking the logarithm of both sides of (14)
yields (13). This result is justified by the following two
relations:
1) dB( 1; 2) = d1R=2( 1; 2) and
2) dH( 1; 2) = 1 exp 12 d1R=2( 1; 2) .</p>
      <p>The revised Wishart [16] and Bartlett distances [5]
can be obtained in a new and simple manner. Indeed,
the revised Wishart distance (dRW) can be derived after
simple manipulations of inequality (11), yielding:
tr( 1 2 1 +
2 1 1)
dRW( 1;
2) =
2
The Bartlett distance arises after taking the logarithm
of both sides of inequality (14). Straightforward algebra
leads to:
ln j 1 + 2j2 2 p ln 2 0:</p>
      <p>j 1jj 2j
The leftmost term in the inequality above is referred to
as the Bartlett distance [5], [16].

      <title>D. Finite sample size behavior</title>
      <p>We assessed the influence of estimation on the size of
the new hypothesis tests using simulated data. To that
end, the study was conducted considering the following
simulation parameters: number of looks n = n1 = n2 2
f4; 8; 16g and the forest covariance matrix shown in (10)
with x = 360932. The sample sizes relate to square
windows of size 7 7, 11 11, and 20 20 pixels, i.e.,
N1; N2 2 f49; 121; 400g. Nominal significance levels
2 f1%; 5%g were verified.</p>
      <p>Let T be the number of Monte Carlo replicas and
R the number of cases for which the null hypothesis
is rejected at nominal level . The empirical test size
is given by b1 = R=T . Following the methodology
described in [14], we employed T = 5500 replicas.</p>
      <p>Table IV presents the empirical test sizes at 1% and
5% nominal levels, the execution time in milliseconds,
the test statistic mean (S), and coefficient of variation
(CV). All numerical calculations and the execution time
quantification were performed, running on a PC with an
Intel Core 2 Duo processor 2.10 GHz, 4 GB of RAM,
Windows XP, and the R platform v. 2.8.1. For each case,
the best obtained empirical sizes and distance means are
in boldface. Results for N1 = 49; N2 = f121; 400g and
N1 = 121; N2 = 400 are consistent with the ones shown,
and are omitted for brevity.</p>
      <p>We tested ten parameters: nine related to the
covariance matrix of order p = 3, and the number of looks L,
leading to test statistics which asymptotically follow 120
distributions. Thus, the statistics expected value should
converge in probability to 10, as a consequence of the
weak law of large numbers. In Table IV, notice that S
tends to 10 as the sample size increases. By fixing the
sample size while varying the number of looks n, test
sizes obey the inequalities SH SB SR SKL, as
illustrated in Fig. 3. These inequalities suggest that, for
this study, the statistics based on the Kullback-Leibler
distance is the best discrimination measure.</p>
      <p>Regarding execution times, the
Kullback-Leiblerbased test presented the best performance, while the
test based on the Hellinger distance showed the best
empirical test size in 6 out of 18 cases.</p>
      <p>The presented methodology for assessing test sizes
was also applied to the three forest samples from the
ESAR image shown in Fig. 1. Each sample was submitted
to the following procedure [14]:
(i) split the sample in disjoint blocks of size N1;
(ii) for each block from (i), split the remaining sample
in disjoint blocks of size N2;
(iii) perform the hypothesis test as described in
Proposition 1 for each pair of samples with sizes N1 and
N2.</p>
      <p>Table V presents the results, omitting some entries
as in Table IV. All test sizes were smaller than the
nominal level, i.e., the proposed tests do not reject the
null hypothesis when similar samples are considered.</p>
      <p>We also made the following study on the
tests power: In each one of T Monte Carlo
experiments, random matrices both of sizes
N 2 f9; 16; 25; 36; 49; 64; 81; 100; 121; 144g were
sampled from the WR( (360932); 4) and from the
WR( (360932) (1 + 0:2); 4) distributions. The
covariance matrix (x) is given in (10), and the
experiment consists in contrasting samples from
the relaxed Wishart distribution it indexes, and the
law indexed by a version scaled by 1:2, arbitrarily
chosen. Subsequently, it was verified whether these
samples come from similar populations according to
Proposition 1. Let R be the number of situations for
which the null hypothesis is rejected at nominal level
; the empirical test power is given by R=T . Fig. 4
presents these estimates for the test power. Notice that
the discrimination ability is about the same for all tests
above N = 49.</p>
      <p>In general terms, the proposed hypothesis tests
presented good results regarding their power even for small
samples: with samples of size 49, they are able to
discriminate between covariance matrices which are only
20% different in about 80% of the time. As the sample
size increases, all the tests discriminate better and better.</p>
      <p>This section presents two applications of the tests
based on stochastic distances. Firstly, a discrimination
analysis was performed in order to assess the influence of
image texture on the tests. It is known that the complex
Wishart distribution is more appropriated for describing
homogeneous regions. However, other polarimetric
distributions, potentially more apt to describing textured
areas, yield intractable expressions which depend on
special functions, such as the hypergeometric and
modified Bessel functions. In order to quantify textures, we
considered distances between relaxed scaled complex
Wishart laws as proposed by Anfinsen et al. [21].
Secondly, stochastic distances are embedded into the
kmeans method in order to identify groups in PolSAR
data. The performance of four distances was assessed by
means of a synthetic image generated from the relaxed
scaled complex Wishart distribution.</p>

        ]. As already presented,
stochastic distances present good discriminatory
properties and, therefore, can be used for identifying clusters
in PolSAR data. To that end, in the following we use the
k-means method with these measures applied to, firstly,
synthetic data, and, secondly, to a PolSAR image.

      <p>Consider N observed covariance matrices Zi, 1

class H`, 1 ` k, with k known. Each class can be
characterized by an unknown centroid C`, 1 ` k,
and the task is assigning each observation to a single
class. Algorithm 1 performs this task using stochastic
distances as dissimilarity criteria.</p>

75 80 pixels with ten regions generated from the scaled
complex Wishart law and 12 looks. The regions have
low, intermediate, and high brightness. The intermediate

while the largest and smallest brightnesses regions are
simulated from the following matrices, respectively:
