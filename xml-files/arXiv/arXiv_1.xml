    <title>NeuralHydrology - Interpreting LSTMs in Hydrology</title>
    <summary>  Despite the huge success of Long Short-Term Memory networks, their
applications in environmental sciences are scarce. We argue that one reason is
the difficulty to interpret the internals of trained networks. In this study,
we look at the application of LSTMs for rainfall-runoff forecasting, one of the
central tasks in the field of hydrology, in which the river discharge has to be
predicted from meteorological observations. LSTMs are particularly well-suited
for this problem since memory cells can represent dynamic reservoirs and
storages, which are essential components in state-space modelling approaches of
the hydrological system. On basis of two different catchments, one with snow
influence and one without, we demonstrate how the trained model can be analyzed
and interpreted. In the process, we show that the network internally learns to
represent patterns that are consistent with our qualitative understanding of
the hydrological system.

    <title>Water Preservation in Soan River Basin using Deep Learning Techniques</title>
    <summary>  Water supplies are crucial for the development of living beings. However,
change in the hydrological process i.e. climate and land usage are the key
issues. Sustaining water level and accurate estimating for dynamic conditions
is a critical job for hydrologists, but predicting hydrological extremes is an
open issue. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning techniques and three
machine learning algorithms to predict stream flow, given the present climate
conditions. The results showed that the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM), an artificial neural network based method, outperform
other conventional and machine-learning algorithms for predicting stream flow.
Furthermore, we analyzed that stream flow is directly affected by
precipitation, land usage, and temperature. These indexes are critical, which
can be used by hydrologists to identify the potential for stream flow. We make
the dataset publicly available (https://github.com/sadaqat007/Dataset) so that
others should be able to replicate and build upon the results published.

    <title>Decentralized Flood Forecasting Using Deep Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  Predicting flood for any location at times of extreme storms is a
longstanding problem that has utmost importance in emergency management.
Conventional methods that aim to predict water levels in streams use advanced
hydrological models still lack of giving accurate forecasts everywhere. This
study aims to explore artificial deep neural networks' performance on flood
prediction. While providing models that can be used in forecasting stream
stage, this paper presents a dataset that focuses on the connectivity of data
points on river networks. It also shows that neural networks can be very
helpful in time-series forecasting as in flood events, and support improving
existing models through data assimilation.

    <title>Learning to regularize with a variational autoencoder for hydrologic
  inverse analysis</title>
    <summary>  Inverse problems often involve matching observational data using a physical
model that takes a large number of parameters as input. These problems tend to
be under-constrained and require regularization to impose additional structure
on the solution in parameter space. A central difficulty in regularization is
turning a complex conceptual model of this additional structure into a
functional mathematical form to be used in the inverse analysis. In this work
we propose a method of regularization involving a machine learning technique
known as a variational autoencoder (VAE). The VAE is trained to map a
low-dimensional set of latent variables with a simple structure to the
high-dimensional parameter space that has a complex structure. We train a VAE
on unconditioned realizations of the parameters for a hydrological inverse
problem. These unconditioned realizations neither rely on the observational
data used to perform the inverse analysis nor require any forward runs of the
physical model, thus making the computational cost of generating the training
data minimal. The central benefit of this approach is that regularization is
then performed on the latent variables from the VAE, which can be regularized
simply. A second benefit of this approach is that the VAE reduces the number of
variables in the optimization problem, thus making gradient-based optimization
more computationally efficient when adjoint methods are unavailable. After
performing regularization and optimization on the latent variables, the VAE
then decodes the problem back to the original parameter space. Our approach
constitutes a novel framework for regularization and optimization, readily
applicable to a wide range of inverse problems. We call the approach RegAE.

    <title>Shallow Water Bathymetry Mapping from UAV Imagery based on Machine
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  The determination of accurate bathymetric information is a key element for
near offshore activities, hydrological studies such as coastal engineering
applications, sedimentary processes, hydrographic surveying as well as
archaeological mapping and biological research. UAV imagery processed with
Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi View Stereo (MVS) techniques can provide
a low-cost alternative to established shallow seabed mapping techniques
offering as well the important visual information. Nevertheless, water
refraction poses significant challenges on depth determination. Till now, this
problem has been addressed through customized image-based refraction correction
algorithms or by modifying the collinearity equation. In this paper, in order
to overcome the water refraction errors, we employ machine learning tools that
are able to learn the systematic underestimation of the estimated depths. In
the proposed approach, based on known depth observations from bathymetric LiDAR
surveys, an SVR model was developed able to estimate more accurately the real
depths of point clouds derived from SfM-MVS procedures. Experimental results
over two test sites along with the performed quantitative validation indicated
the high potential of the developed approach.

    <title>Exploiting Capacity of Sewer System Using Unsupervised Learning
  Algorithms Combined with Dimensionality Reduction</title>
    <summary>  Exploiting capacity of sewer system using decentralized control is a cost
effective mean of minimizing the overflow. Given the size of the real sewer
system, exploiting all the installed control structures in the sewer pipes can
be challenging. This paper presents a divide and conquer solution to implement
decentralized control measures based on unsupervised learning algorithms. A
sewer system is first divided into a number of subcatchments. A series of
natural and built factors that have the impact on sewer system performance is
then collected. Clustering algorithms are then applied to grouping
subcatchments with similar hydraulic hydrologic characteristics. Following
which, principal component analysis is performed to interpret the main features
of sub-catchment groups and identify priority control locations. Overflows
under different control scenarios are compared based on the hydraulic model.
Simulation results indicate that priority control applied to the most suitable
cluster could bring the most profitable result.

    <title>DeepCSO: Forecasting of Combined Sewer Overflow at a Citywide Level
  using Multi-task Deep Learning</title>
    <summary>  Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) is a major problem to be addressed by many
cities. Understanding the behavior of sewer system through proper urban
hydrological models is an effective method of enhancing sewer system
management. Conventional deterministic methods, which heavily rely on physical
principles, is inappropriate for real-time purpose due to their expensive
computation. On the other hand, data-driven methods have gained huge interests,
but most studies only focus on modeling a single component of the sewer system
and supply information at a very abstract level. In this paper, we proposed the
DeepCSO model, which aims at forecasting CSO events from multiple CSO
structures simultaneously in near real time at a citywide level. The proposed
model provided an intermediate methodology that combines the flexibility of
data-driven methods and the rich information contained in deterministic methods
while avoiding the drawbacks of these two methods. A comparison of the results
demonstrated that the deep learning based multi-task model is superior to the
traditional methods.

    <title>Combining Physically-Based Modeling and Deep Learning for Fusing GRACE
  Satellite Data: Can We Learn from Mismatch?</title>
    <summary>  Global hydrological and land surface models are increasingly used for
tracking terrestrial total water storage (TWS) dynamics, but the utility of
existing models is hampered by conceptual and/or data uncertainties related to
various underrepresented and unrepresented processes, such as groundwater
storage. The gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) satellite mission
provided a valuable independent data source for tracking TWS at regional and
continental scales. Strong interests exist in fusing GRACE data into global
hydrological models to improve their predictive performance. Here we develop
and apply deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to learn the
spatiotemporal patterns of mismatch between TWS anomalies (TWSA) derived from
GRACE and those simulated by NOAH, a widely used land surface model. Once
trained, our CNN models can be used to correct the NOAH simulated TWSA without
requiring GRACE data, potentially filling the data gap between GRACE and its
follow-on mission, GRACE-FO. Our methodology is demonstrated over India, which
has experienced significant groundwater depletion in recent decades that is
nevertheless not being captured by the NOAH model. Results show that the CNN
models significantly improve the match with GRACE TWSA, achieving a
country-average correlation coefficient of 0.94 and Nash-Sutcliff efficient of
0.87, or 14\% and 52\% improvement respectively over the original NOAH TWSA. At
the local scale, the learned mismatch pattern correlates well with the observed
in situ groundwater storage anomaly data for most parts of India, suggesting
that deep learning models effectively compensate for the missing groundwater
component in NOAH for this study region.

    <title>A Learning Framework for An Accurate Prediction of Rainfall Rates</title>
    <summary>  The present work is aimed to examine the potential of advanced machine
learning strategies to predict the monthly rainfall (precipitation) for the
Indus Basin, using climatological variables such as air temperature,
geo-potential height, relative humidity and elevation. In this work, the focus
is on thirteen geographical locations, called index points, within the basin.
Arguably, not all of the hydrological components are relevant to the
precipitation rate, and therefore, need to be filtered out, leading to a
lower-dimensional feature space. Towards this goal, we adopted the gradient
boosting method to extract the most contributive features for precipitation
rate prediction. Five state-of-the-art machine learning methods have then been
trained where pearson correlation coefficient and mean absolute error have been
reported as the prediction performance criteria. The Random Forest regression
model outperformed the other regression models achieving the maximum pearson
correlation coefficient and minimum mean absolute error for most of the index
points. Our results suggest the relative humidity (for pressure levels of 300
mb and 150 mb, respectively), the u-direction wind (for pressure level of 700
mb), air temperature (for pressure levels of 150 mb and 10 mb, respectively) as
the top five influencing features for accurate forecasting the precipitation
rate.

    <title>High-Dimensional Dependency Structure Learning for Physical Processes</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we consider the use of structure learning methods for
probabilistic graphical models to identify statistical dependencies in
high-dimensional physical processes. Such processes are often synthetically
characterized using PDEs (partial differential equations) and are observed in a
variety of natural phenomena, including geoscience data capturing atmospheric
and hydrological phenomena. Classical structure learning approaches such as the
PC algorithm and variants are challenging to apply due to their high
computational and sample requirements. Modern approaches, often based on sparse
regression and variants, do come with finite sample guarantees, but are usually
highly sensitive to the choice of hyper-parameters, e.g., parameter $\lambda$
for sparsity inducing constraint or regularization. In this paper, we present
ACLIME-ADMM, an efficient two-step algorithm for adaptive structure learning,
which estimates an edge specific parameter $\lambda_{ij}$ in the first step,
and uses these parameters to learn the structure in the second step. Both steps
of our algorithm use (inexact) ADMM to solve suitable linear programs, and all
iterations can be done in closed form in an efficient block parallel manner. We
compare ACLIME-ADMM with baselines on both synthetic data simulated by partial
differential equations (PDEs) that model advection-diffusion processes, and
real data (50 years) of daily global geopotential heights to study information
flow in the atmosphere. ACLIME-ADMM is shown to be efficient, stable, and
competitive, usually better than the baselines especially on difficult
problems. On real data, ACLIME-ADMM recovers the underlying structure of global
atmospheric circulation, including switches in wind directions at the equator
and tropics entirely from the data.

    <title>Prolongation of SMAP to Spatio-temporally Seamless Coverage of
  Continental US Using a Deep Learning Neural Network</title>
    <summary>  The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has delivered valuable
sensing of surface soil moisture since 2015. However, it has a short time span
and irregular revisit schedule. Utilizing a state-of-the-art time-series deep
learning neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), we created a system
that predicts SMAP level-3 soil moisture data with atmospheric forcing,
model-simulated moisture, and static physiographic attributes as inputs. The
system removes most of the bias with model simulations and improves predicted
moisture climatology, achieving small test root-mean-squared error (&lt;0.035) and
high correlation coefficient &gt;0.87 for over 75\% of Continental United States,
including the forested Southeast. As the first application of LSTM in
hydrology, we show the proposed network avoids overfitting and is robust for
both temporal and spatial extrapolation tests. LSTM generalizes well across
regions with distinct climates and physiography. With high fidelity to SMAP,
LSTM shows great potential for hindcasting, data assimilation, and weather
forecasting.

    <title>A trans-disciplinary review of deep learning research for water
  resources scientists</title>
    <summary>  Deep learning (DL), a new-generation of artificial neural network research,
has transformed industries, daily lives and various scientific disciplines in
recent years. DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural
networks to automatically engineer problem-relevant features and capture highly
complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new
and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as
inter-disciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality,
and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to
provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple
technical overview, trans-disciplinary progress update, and a source of
inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various
physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data
challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially
suited for information extraction from image-like data and sequential data.
Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance
to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a
scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed 'AI neuroscience,' where
scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights,
has been born. This budding sub-discipline has demonstrated methods including
correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features,
reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of
network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition
neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus
revealing emergent behaviors of these units. Vast opportunities exist for DL to
propel advances in water sciences.

    <title>Towards Global Remote Discharge Estimation: Using the Few to Estimate
  The Many</title>
    <summary>  Learning hydrologic models for accurate riverine flood prediction at scale is
a challenge of great importance. One of the key difficulties is the need to
rely on in-situ river discharge measurements, which can be quite scarce and
unreliable, particularly in regions where floods cause the most damage every
year. Accordingly, in this work we tackle the problem of river discharge
estimation at different river locations. A core characteristic of the data at
hand (e.g. satellite measurements) is that we have few measurements for many
locations, all sharing the same physics that underlie the water discharge. We
capture this scenario in a simple but powerful common mechanism regression
(CMR) model with a local component as well as a shared one which captures the
global discharge mechanism. The resulting learning objective is non-convex, but
we show that we can find its global optimum by leveraging the power of joining
local measurements across sites. In particular, using a spectral initialization
with provable near-optimal accuracy, we can find the optimum using standard
descent methods. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for the problem of
discharge estimation using simulations.

    <title>Theory-guided Data Science: A New Paradigm for Scientific Discovery from
  Data</title>
    <summary>  Data science models, although successful in a number of commercial domains,
have had limited applicability in scientific problems involving complex
physical phenomena. Theory-guided data science (TGDS) is an emerging paradigm
that aims to leverage the wealth of scientific knowledge for improving the
effectiveness of data science models in enabling scientific discovery. The
overarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as an
essential component for learning generalizable models. Further, by producing
scientifically interpretable models, TGDS aims to advance our scientific
understanding by discovering novel domain insights. Indeed, the paradigm of
TGDS has started to gain prominence in a number of scientific disciplines such
as turbulence modeling, material discovery, quantum chemistry, bio-medical
science, bio-marker discovery, climate science, and hydrology. In this paper,
we formally conceptualize the paradigm of TGDS and present a taxonomy of
research themes in TGDS. We describe several approaches for integrating domain
knowledge in different research themes using illustrative examples from
different disciplines. We also highlight some of the promising avenues of novel
research for realizing the full potential of theory-guided data science.

    <title>PoincarÃ© inequalities on intervals -- application to sensitivity
  analysis</title>
    <summary>  The development of global sensitivity analysis of numerical model outputs has
recently raised new issues on 1-dimensional Poincar\'e inequalities. Typically
two kind of sensitivity indices are linked by a Poincar\'e type inequality,
which provide upper bounds of the most interpretable index by using the other
one, cheaper to compute. This allows performing a low-cost screening of
unessential variables. The efficiency of this screening then highly depends on
the accuracy of the upper bounds in Poincar\'e inequalities. The novelty in the
questions concern the wide range of probability distributions involved, which
are often truncated on intervals. After providing an overview of the existing
knowledge and techniques, we add some theory about Poincar\'e constants on
intervals, with improvements for symmetric intervals. Then we exploit the
spectral interpretation for computing exact value of Poincar\'e constants of
any admissible distribution on a given interval. We give semi-analytical
results for some frequent distributions (truncated exponential, triangular,
truncated normal), and present a numerical method in the general case. Finally,
an application is made to a hydrological problem, showing the benefits of the
new results in Poincar\'e inequalities to sensitivity analysis.

    <title>Development and analysis of a Bayesian water balance model for large
  lake systems</title>
    <summary>  Water balance models (WBMs) are often employed to understand regional
hydrologic cycles over various time scales. Most WBMs, however, are
physically-based, and few employ state-of-the-art statistical methods to
reconcile independent input measurement uncertainty and bias. Further, few WBMs
exist for large lakes, and most large lake WBMs perform additive accounting,
with minimal consideration towards input data uncertainty. Here, we introduce a
framework for improving a previously developed large lake statistical water
balance model (L2SWBM). Focusing on the water balances of Lakes Superior and
Michigan-Huron, we demonstrate our new analytical framework, identifying
L2SWBMs from 26 alternatives that adequately close the water balance of the
lakes with satisfactory computation times compared with the prototype model. We
expect our new framework will be used to develop water balance models for other
lakes around the world.
