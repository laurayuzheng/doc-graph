        <p>The article analyses co-authorship and co-citation networks in Food Policy, which is the most important agricultural policy journal in the field of agricultural economics. The paper highlights the principal researchers in this field together with their authorship and citation networks on the basis of 714 articles written between 2006 and 2015. Results suggest that the majority of the articles were written by a small number of researchers, indicating that groups and central authors play an important role in scientific advances. It also turns out that the number of articles and the central role played in the network are not related, contrary to expectations. Results also suggest that groups cite themselves more often than average, thereby boosting the scientific advancement of their own members.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>
        The number of articles published globally in different scientific areas has increased exponentially
in recent years, and the behavior of those involved in scientific production itself has changed over
time [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ]. Despite the clear importance of the topic, analyses of co-authorship and co-citation networks
operating mainly in the field of agricultural economics or agribusiness, are scarce. As [2] state, the link
between scientific collaboration in a research project and the impact of the research results have been
investigated in only a small number of studies.
      </p>
      <p>During the analysis of co-authorship patterns in a single journal or conference, many authors
adopt and implement methods from Social Network Analysis (SNA), the second stream of the research
methodology which is relevant in this case [3].</p>
      <p>
        In an attempt to evaluate the quality of scientific publications, different efforts have been made to
measure their influence [4]. We can agree that the benefits of collaboration between researchers are
almost universal. Actual samples of behaviour in terms of cooperation can depend on the country of
origin, disciplines, research institutions, or journals [5]. Publishing habits have changed dramatically in
the past years, both in regard to Food Policy specifically and to all scientific journals in general. With the
spread of the Internet and online journals, authors are now able to rapidly acquire access to published
research and working papers. But how have these changes influenced the quantity of citations and
the types of the cited articles? It is important to answer this question because the number of citations
for the articles published in a journal, via statistics such as the impact factor or the Hirsch index,
is increasingly being used as a metric of journal quality and stature [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">6</xref>
        ]. In Ko˝míves and Dajnoki [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">7</xref>
        ]’s
summary of the most important metric elements of the different international and Hungarian higher
educational ranking systems, the authors revealed that, for example, the Shanghai Jiao Tong University
ranking, which is the best known ranking system of the world, pays much attention to publications
and citations in the most important international journals—such as Nature or Science. The relevance of
the different factors during the analysis of the position of each university in comparison with other
higher educational institutions is still not finalized: as Hazelkorn [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">8</xref>
        ] showed, we can still find debates
about the relevance of the number of publications or citations. On the other hand, it is clear to all that
the strength or the impact of the research or scientific cooperation cannot only be analyzed on the basis
of the number of papers or citations alone—this process is much more complex [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">9</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>More specifically, we investigate the following hypotheses in this paper:</p>
      <sec id="sec-1-1">
        <title>Hypothesis (H1). Significant changes occurred in the subject matter examined by researchers in the 10-year-period from 2006 to 2015.</title>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-1-2">
        <title>Hypothesis (H2). The majority of articles are written by various research groups rather than one single author.</title>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-1-3">
        <title>Hypothesis (H3). The key members of the network have the best publication performance.</title>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-1-4">
        <title>Hypothesis (H4). The articles by influential authors are cited more due to their centrality ranking.</title>
        <p>Following this introduction, the paper is structured as follows. The literature review provides a
brief description of the theoretical background of social network analysis in general, and particularly
in scientific collaboration. The third section describes materials and methods used for the analysis.
In the fourth section, the results are presented with descriptive statistics used to describe the basic
features of the data in a study, followed by co-authorship network and co-citation network analysis.
In the fifth section we summarize in a discussion and draw the main conclusions.</p>

        <title>2.1. Collaboration, Competition, or Coopetition?</title>
        <p>
          During the analysis of the international cooperation in the fields of research and publications,
scientists face several issues they have to resolve to ensure the success of their collaboration.
We investigated the structural pathology of different networks. The importance of international
cooperation and networks has significantly increased in the past three decades [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">10</xref>
          ]. The risks of
inter-organizational cooperation can cause different pathologies. These pathologies are able to bring
benefits for international cooperating partners not only in business cases [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">11</xref>
          ], but also in the case
of scientific networks. [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">12</xref>
          ] uses the word “coopetition” to describe the special habit or behavior of
different companies: they partly cooperate with each other but on the other hand they are—at the
same time—competitors as well. They work together on several issues, but they are all chasing
the same customers. We can apply the same concept to international research communities as
well—of course these communities are not interested in attracting “customers”, but they have to
find those potential partners who are able to fund the research and the operation of higher educational
institutions and research institutions. To become reliable partners for international cooperating
partners, research groups have to implement and respect international research ethical norms—just as
Sroka and Lo˝rinczy [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">13</xref>
          ] wrote in their article when describing relevant expectations for companies
facing business ethical rules and practices. That means the role of the research group leader will
become more important—similarly to business life, where the role of the manager is a key component,
too. As Sroka and Gajdzik [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">14</xref>
          ] found that the manager is the key to the network’s success, we can
define the leader of the research group as a key actor as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the implementation of this aspect of the business world to the academic sector, institutions
and researchers face almost the same problems. Cross-border cooperation between different institutions
and individual researchers seems to be a good idea—but on the other hand, higher educational
institutions and research institutions are rivals when the institution leaders try to attract future
students, sponsors, partners, etc. As Hazelkorn [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">15</xref>
          ] noted, the Shanghai Jiao Tong Ranking System is
mainly based on the quality of the publications written by the researchers employed by each university.
Publishing research of high quality and significant impact is fundamental to progress in the sciences
and social sciences. From a career perspective, the perceived research performance of individual
researchers can be crucial for hiring, tenure, and promotion decisions worldwide [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">16</xref>
          ]. It is one thing to
use impact factors to compare journals and quite another to use them to compare authors. Journal
impact factors generally involve relatively large populations of articles and citations. Indeed, most
metrics relating to impact and quality are based on citation data [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">17</xref>
          ]. Of course, the ranking system
also pays attention to many other factors (e.g., size, social and other impacts etc.) but the measurement
of the publications’ quality is driven in the same way that we used to analyze it during our research:
it is mainly based on the Scopus and WoS peer reviewed publications—and on Nature or Science
publications. Analyzing the co-authorship patterns can be a useful way to enrich these evaluation
methods, which can help to allocate resources to the research community which can use them in the
best way [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">18</xref>
          ]. The importance of fundraising can be crucial: some fields of research can get much
support from the private sector. As Calero et al. [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">19</xref>
          ] reported in the bio-pharmaceutical sector, the most
important multinational companies spend about 15% of their sales on research and development.
        </p>
        <p>Publishing research of high quality and significant impact is fundamental to progress in the
sciences and social sciences.</p>
        <p>
          Coopetition can be a good solution for higher educational institutions as well. The theory is
mainly relevant for business enterprises, but it can be adapted to the academic sector as well. During
the coopetition process, companies try to do the best for themselves. Sometimes they cooperate with
each other and sometimes they compete. Sometimes they are able to reach their aims at the expense
of the other company and sometimes not. The model is based on game theory—but the aim is not to
create a win-lose situation [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">20</xref>
          ].

        <title>2.2. Social Network Analysis</title>
        <p>
          Analysis of social networks can be achieved by analyzing the structural characteristics of the
network. We can identify the key features of social networks as the users and their connections [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">21</xref>
          ].
These links create the structure of the network. While not without their accompanying problems, as
noted by [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">22</xref>
          ], structural and topological attributes have been used in several studies to understand the
nuances and the importance of human behavior in social networks [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">23</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          Social Network Analysis (SNA) has developed as a specialty in parallel with scientometrics
since the end of the 1970s. In a foundational work. Freeman [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">24</xref>
          ] developed a set of measures of
centrality based on betweenness. Freeman stated that “betweenness” as a structural characteristic
of communication was described in the literature as the first measure of centrality [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref25">25,26</xref>
          ]. The SNA
point of view on social relationships in terms of network theory can consist of nodes and ties (also
called edges, links, or connections). Nodes (or, as they are called in the ferial usage: junctions) are the
individual actors creating the networks, and ties are the relationships between them. The resulting
graph-based structures are often very complex. We can state that research in several academic fields
has shown that social networks operate on different levels and play a crucial role in determining
the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed
in achieving their goals [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">27</xref>
          ]. SNA is a wide strategy during the investigation of social structure [3]
and is used to gain patterns of relationships between the nodes mentioned above to ascertain an
underlying social structure [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">28</xref>
          ]. SNA integrated the narrative data analysis while it provided a way
of examining the relation structure among the people, organisations, and the places they mentioned
across each of the interviews. This versatile approach was particularly useful because it provided not
only a possibility to analyze the specific links individuals had with one another, with places and with
organizations [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">29</xref>
          ], but also because one of the main aims of SNA is to identify the core actors in a
network [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">30</xref>
          ] and to find and interpret patterns of social ties among actors [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">31</xref>
          ]. The role of SNA has
increased recently because the topic plays an important role in several disciplines [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">3,32</xref>
          ]. Network
analysis permits the investigation of the characteristics of management to compare with other fields
of knowledge, as well as the existing linkages between the most central and most prominent authors
within the examined discipline. Finally, network analysis gives a greater understanding of which
authors collaborate, of the social groups that emerge from the collaboration relationships, of the role
played by the most important ‘star authors’, and of the impact of their belonging to certain institutions
and journals [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">33</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the graph theory [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">34</xref>
          ], SNA is able to make the web of social interactions visible, both on
global and individual levels. The former seeks to describe the characteristics of these networks as
a whole (e.g., distance, clusters, etc.), while the latter refers to the analysis of the individual actors
(e.g., status, position, etc.). The status of every actor can be described by centrality, as evident from the
methodological chapter below.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-3">
        <title>2.3. Co-Author Network</title>
        <p>
          Co-author networks can be defined as a type of social network, and paper citation networks as a
type of information science network. These two different types of networks are thoroughly studied,
especially in the complex networks field [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30 ref34 ref35 ref36">31,35–37</xref>
          ]. Co-author and paper citation networks in different
disciplines were studied by complex network researchers [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37 ref38 ref39 ref40">38–41</xref>
          ]. Co-authorship networks, as one of
the most understandable and well-known forms of collaboration networks [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">42</xref>
          ], are built on the social
dimension of the relatedness of different authors [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">43</xref>
          ]. Studies of cooperation networks can cluster
forms based on co-authorships, and then identify the “invisible community” within a field [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">30</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          The research and publishing method has changed dramatically over the past decades. 60–70 years
ago, the most scientific research was done by individual researchers publishing single-authored articles.
Later this changed significantly: while in 1950, only 8% of articles published in the American Economic
Review were co-authored, the co-authorship rate increased to 55% by 1993 [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">44</xref>
          ] and to 81% in 2014.
This trend was noted in the 1980s as well: as McDowell and Melvin [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">45</xref>
          ] stated, the percentage of
co-authored articles in the field of economics increased between 1946 and 1976 from less than 5% to
more than 30%. As an outcome of the trend towards co-authorship, academic interest in collaboration
has increased among researchers [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref45 ref46 ref47 ref48">37,46–49</xref>
          ]. Nowadays, science is more accessible and freer than
it has ever been before and—because of globalization—there is a particularly growing interest in
scientific collaboration. This collaboration can take various forms (e.g., research projects, publications
in peer-reviewed journals or in conference papers). According to [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">50</xref>
          ], collaboration is mostly facilitated
by technological advances, geographical proximity, and the similarity of the actual research topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can define the two most important aspects of collaborations that boost research outcomes: first
the growing number of publications, and second the number of citations received. Citations of articles
published in academic journals are central to the scholarly venture. Citations are considered a mark
of the research contribution made by an article—a sign that the new scientific outcome is valuable
to other scholars [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">51</xref>
          ]. Based on the research completed by [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">52</xref>
          ], we can declare that the number of
references increases with the number of co-authors and this effect can become more efficient if the
latter are from different institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the differences between research fields can mean differences in variables related to
citations [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">53</xref>
          ], several common factors come up. These are in line with the conclusions of [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">54</xref>
          ] and
include the length of the article [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">55</xref>
          ], the number of co-authors [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55 ref56">56,57</xref>
          ], whether the publication is a
review paper [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54 ref57">55,58</xref>
          ], the seniority of the authors [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52 ref57">53,58</xref>
          ], and the affiliation of the authors [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54 ref58">55,59</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>When a scientist publishes together with their colleagues, they can establish a scientific network.
After the analysis of such networks, we can acquire a useful picture of the relationships between
individual authors.</p>
        <p>
          Differences between partners (potential co-authors) and their different motivations for
undertaking and developing sustainable international and interorganizational cooperation are
important issues in terms of the prospects for this cooperation [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">60</xref>
          ]. We agree with the idea that the
harmonization of international collaboration is primarily the result of improving its key determinant,
which is people and higher educational and research institutions, and it has become clear that all the
factors are related to the partnership [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">61</xref>
          ]. Several studies have sought to determine the measurement
of collaboration performance [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">62</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          We can state that scientific networks are usually formed around prominent researchers. These
well-known scientists mostly work as a hub in attracting a large number of researchers from several
different universities and research institutions [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">50</xref>
          ]. According to [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">47</xref>
          ], research collaboration increases
research quality and leads to more often cited co-authored papers. Narin et al. [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">63</xref>
          ] found that
internationally co-authored papers can result in twice as many citations as single-authored ones.
Sooryamoorthy [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">64</xref>
          ] also found a significant positive correlation between the number of co-authors
and the number of citations linked to articles published by South African scientists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier studies have shown that scientific collaboration (especially the trends towards
co-authorship) produces a higher research impact than a single researcher in terms of the number of
articles [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">65</xref>
          ] and citations [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">2,64</xref>
          ]. This may come from the fact that a single researcher cannot effectively
mobilize all the resources needed for conducting research [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">66</xref>
          ].
        </p>

          Co-authorship analysis can be used to ascertain the position of an author in the cooperation
network. It might provide important information on the scientists’ own contribution to the research
output included in their official scientific biography. In conjunction with the h-core analysis, this helps
to clarify details on the extent of the examined scientist’s real contribution to the research output
shared by themselves and the achieved citation impact of these publications [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">67</xref>
          ]. The leanness of the
connections across the communities denotes the fact that most of the journals which belong to the same
community tend to cite the same publications within their community, and rarely reference articles
from other communities [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">68</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          Journal rankings might also have an impact on global scientific collaboration because publishing in
more prestigious scientific journals in many countries has a higher value in most academic performance
indicators. Several authors and research groups have analyzed different discipline-specific journal
rankings and quality (see e.g., [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68 ref69">69,70</xref>
          ]). Funding the different research groups might depend on the
prestige of their publications and the number—and quality—of citations they receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past few years, an improvement has appeared in bibliometrics, as a result of which
citation impact will no longer be restricted to the “times cited” factor, but a more specific analysis
will be carried out [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">71</xref>
          ]. For example, during the preparation of different bibliometric analyses the
citation context is considered, in order to get deeper and more detailed information on the impact
of publications and how the analyzed cited publications are perceived [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">72</xref>
          ]. Authors may cite the
work of others (or themselves) for different reasons and these can vary from purely rational to mostly
accidental [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">73</xref>
          ]. Citation indexes are widely used in scientometrics during the evaluation of the
quality and impact of scientific publications. However, although citation index based metrics remain a
fundamental component in the evaluation process on the research performance of every single author
or research community, it alone cannot reflect all the variable aspects of scientific communication [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">74</xref>
          ].
Most of the articles we analyzed during our research have dealt with specific distributions of citations.
We can define a group of good examples: the sleeping beauties. These are articles which generate little
or no citation impact over a longer period (e.g., 10 years), before they start to generate stupendous
impact. According to [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">75</xref>
          ], the phenomenon of sleeping beauties is also labeled (from the viewpoint
of the authors or co-authors of the article citing the original publication) as resisted or premature
discoveries, delayed recognition, or information awakening. Several authors have published articles
on sleeping beauties’ studies, e.g., [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref75 ref76">76,77</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          Bibliometrically, the collaboration of authors or author communities is not normally viewed or
studied graphically, but rather described as a social phenomenon with different factors, including
economic factors and factors from many other fields of research [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">78</xref>
          ], intrascientific factors [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">25</xref>
          ], scientific
acknowledgement factors (describing the recognition of a scientific publication) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">79</xref>
          ], organizational
factors [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">42</xref>
          ], geographical factors [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79">80</xref>
          ], social stratification factors (describing the different groups of
society) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">81</xref>
          ], sector factors [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref81">82</xref>
          ], and—one of the most important factors from the viewpoint of the
fundraising and sponsorship of research work—academic credit factors. The general trend observed in
the most influential scientific journals is an increase in activities driven by collaboration both between
researchers and between research institutions and universities, especially with regard to international
co-authorship [5] and citation networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the whole, co-authorship and citation networks can be defined as social networks as well,
but we should always keep in mind that co-authorship implies a much stronger social bond than
citation. A Citation Network (CN) is defined as a type of information network which represents the
network of relatedness of subject matter [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref82">83</xref>
          ]. A CN is a special kind of social network. The first
analyses of this phenomenon was completed by [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">2,78</xref>
          ] in his seminal paper titled “Networks of
Scientific Papers”. Citation network analysis is a perfect tool for evaluation, but the combination
of the knowledge coming from qualitative and quantitative reviews is the most efficient means of
evaluating a research field [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref83">84</xref>
          ]. Archambault, Campbell, Gingras and Larivière [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">85</xref>
          ] have demonstrated
a high correlation between the number of articles and the number of citations received by country.
Their calculation was based on Scopus and on WoS, and thus drew the conclusion that both databases
are suitable tools for analyses in scientometrics. Gavel and Iselid [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">86</xref>
          ] nalyzed the paper coverage
overlap between WoS and Scopus, based on 2006 data and showed that, at the time, 54% of active
article titles in Scopus were also available in WoS and that 84% of active article titles in WoS were
indexed in Scopus as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is unarguable that high quality publications are needed to develop a personal researcher
career [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">33</xref>
          ]. When a researcher publishes together with their co-authors, they create a unique and
individual co-author network. This co-author network includes all those who have added their
own knowledge to the common database significantly and on merit during the preparation of the
article. Imaging these personal networks together, we can create a sample on which the connections
between the authors and co-authors can be analyzed. Earlier studies have shown that collaboration
makes the research achievement of the co-authors better and more effective [2]. Actually, many
scientometric studies have evidenced the significance of the different socio-economic variables (e.g.,
HDI) in scientific production measurement based on the nationality or the country of residence and
collaboration patterns [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref86">87</xref>
          ]. Overall, countries with a high gross domestic product (in US dollars per
capita) have invested more in scientific development aimed to promote an increase in publications [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref87">88</xref>
          ]
and to reach this aim.

bibliographical abstract and citation search database [

        ]. Despite the apparent importance of the
topic, there has been little analytical research on co-authorship and co-citation networks in the field of
agricultural economics. According to the InCites Journal Citation Reports, there were 17 journals in

      <p>Food Policy with the highest impact factor was selected for our research because it is a
multidisciplinary journal on issues in implementation and evaluation of policies for the food sector
in developing, transition, and advanced economies considering papers from any of the social
sciences. Furthermore, Food Policy prioritize economic and social aspects of empirical studies on
international food policy debates and is the most relevant journal with its highest ranking in the field
of agricultural economics.</p>
      <p>The basis of our sample is comprised of the 714 papers published between 2006 and 2015.
Altogether, these papers originated from 1708 different authors. If redundancies are also taken into
consideration, this number is 2119. In our analysis, we also examined the 8749 citations referring to
these papers, 6456 of which originated from different papers. Altogether, the examined sample consists
of 6838 papers, not considering redundancies.</p>

          Gephi is an open source network exploration and manipulation software. Developed modules
can import, visualize, spatialize, filter, manipulate, and export all types of networks. The visualization
module uses a special 3D render engine to render graphs in real-time. This technique uses the computer
graphics card, as video games do, and leaves the CPU free for other computing. It can deal with large
networks (i.e., over 20,000 nodes) and, because it is built on a multi-task model, it takes advantage of
multi-core processors. The user interface is structured into Workspaces, where separate work can be
done, and a powerful plugin system is currently being developed. Great attention has been taken to the
extendibility of the software. An algorithm, filter, or tool can be easily added to the program, with little
programming experience. Sets of nodes or edges can be obtained manually or by using the filter system.
Filters can select nodes or edges with thresholds, ranges, and other properties. In practice, filter boxes
are chained, each box takes in input, the output of the upper box [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref89">90</xref>
          ]. Dynamic network visualization
offers possibilities to understand structure transition or content propagation [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref90">91</xref>

networks in an easy and intuitive way has been incorporated into Gephi from the beginning.

          We used the Yifan Hu Multilevel layout algorithm which is an algorithm that brings together the
good elements of force-directed algorithms and a multilevel algorithm to reduce algorithm complexity.

        <p>Our network analysis comprises the analysis of the below centrality markers. Our betweenness
centrality analysis reveals which participants’ cooperation keeps the relationship going. In other words,
we will identify which participants are most able to control the information flowing in the network.
In this regard, the key author will be the one that stands in between multiple other authors, as this
means they have a high chance of standing on the path between two authors.</p>
        <p>
          Our closeness centrality research aims to identify which authors are able to reach all members of
the network—primarily within their own clique—directly, rapidly, and easily, without relying on any
third member. Authors can also be ranked based on their degree of centrality. This value reflects how
many other authors the given author is linked to, i.e., it shows how many incoming or outgoing links
the node (i.e., the author) has. This helps identify which authors have a central role with regards to
publications in the subject area of our research [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref92">93</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>In order to be able to present visual graphs, we transferred the nodes and links into Excel, which
was then imported into the program. The records (nodes) were provided by an existing table containing
the ID number and full name of the author. We used the ID codes of the articles and the ID number of
the author to identify the relationships between the nodes (i.e., the links). If an article was published
by multiple authors, then the ID code of the article (along with the ID number of the author) is shown
in the table once for each of the authors it was written by. These data provided a table that—based on
the ID numbers—made it possible to identify which other authors each author is linked to.

          <p>Furthermore, scientific cliques have been analyzed, since 82% of the authors in our sample worked
in cliques of at least 3 authors. Table 3 lists the members of the three largest cliques, each of which has
at least 40 members. It is remarkable that only 139 authors (8% of all authors) were able to get into
these cliques, which also means that most researchers in the sample were working in smaller groups
that are visibly more peripheral in Figure 4.</p>

        <title>4.3. Co-Citation Network</title>
        <p>After analysing the relationships between authors, we also examined the network of citations,
as we assumed that references to the individual authors and publications are an acknowledgement of
the authors’ performance. The 714 articles in our sample were referenced in a total of 8856 articles,
which means an average of 12 citations per article. Of all citations, 622 “refer back” to the sample
articles, which means a 7% citation ratio within the journal.</p>
        <p>Table 4 suggests that the most cited article is not necessarily the most important one from a
network perspective, i.e., it does not necessarily rank higher in terms of pagerank—it is also important
who the article was cited by. A good example of this is article number 9 in Figure 6. In terms of citation,
the article only ranks ninth; however, it comes third with regards to pagerank. Comparing the results
in Tables 3 and 4, it seems that the 10 most cited articles were not written by authors of the three most
significant cliques. Of all these articles, only article No. 4 was written by members of one of the 3 most
significant cliques (Maria Loireiro és Wendy Umberger in clique No 1).</p>
        <p>Figure 6 shows the citation network of the 10 most cited articles from Table 4. Looking at this
network article by article shows that each of the most cited articles were written by authors of one of
the scientific cliques, which confirms the outstanding importance of cliques.</p>
        <p>Finally, we have determined the influencing factors using the regression of the number of citations.
Table 5 clearly shows that pagerank and betweenness values affect the number of citations positively,
whereas closeness has a negative effect. In other words, an author’s central role in the network has
a significant impact on the number of times they get cited. The results in Table 5 also show that
researchers playing an intermediary role (based on high betweenness values) get more citations than
their peers who are ranked higher based on other values of the network. Our results are 1% significant
and our model is in line with all preliminary regression conditions.

approaches. The first of these approaches is to analyze the reasons why authors collaborate and to
different approaches. The first of these approaches is to analyze the reasons why authors collaborate

analyze the consequences of such decisions [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47 ref90">48,91</xref>
        ]. The basis of the second approach is the idea that
co-authorship is able to create a social network of researchers [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35 ref45">36,46</xref>
        ]. The results of the analysis show
that indicators of centrality play important role in taking advantage of non-redundant resources in
a network aimed to increase the level of co-authorship, thereby significantly affecting citations for
publications. On the other hand, they found that prolific co-author count, team exploration, and
publishing tenure all have indirect effects on the number of citations. Specifically, writing an article in
co-authorship with prolific scholars helps scientists develop centralities and generates higher numbers
of citations. Researchers with longer publishing tenure (who are used to publishing more) tend to
have higher degrees of centrality in the analyzed networks [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref96">97</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        We also confirmed H3 as we found a positive correlation between the number of publications and
betweenness and pagerank values. Finally, the results of H4 show that centrality values clearly affect
the number of citations. This is exactly in line with the results of studies by [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73 ref97">74,98</xref>
        ], which confirmed a
positive correlation between centrality values and citation values.
      </p>
      <p>We are aware that our selection method has limitations. First, our sample is only valid for articles
published in the selected Food Policy journal. The analysis presented in this paper suffers from
limitations that could be dealt with in future work. Our sample of articles covers what has been
published in the main international journal of agricultural economics but fails to include articles in
another 16 journals in the category of agricultural economics and policy reported by InCites Journal
Citation Reports. Furthermore, the list of journals to survey could also be expanded to include
non-English language peer-reviewed journals in Europe. The dataset could even go beyond journal
articles to capture conference papers and studies produced in an advisory capacity (for the World Bank,
the European Commission, FAO etc.). The question arises whether these other types of publication are
characterized by the same authors and co-authorship networks as the journal articles.</p>
      <p>It can be observed that the journal literature is moving towards more method-driven articles
resembling the conference paper literature in terms of collaboration and becomes increasingly distinct
from the more issue-driven studies that are produced for international and financial institutions.
Citation network analysis of conference papers and advisory studies discussed above can be of interest
as well, presumably revealing more links between the relatively disconnected components in the
co-authorship network, as authors who do not necessarily collaborate directly nevertheless make use
of and cite each others’ work.</p>
