Automated Ground Truth Estimation of Vulnerable Road Users in Automotive
  Radar Data Using GNSS
  Annotating automotive radar data is a difficult task. This article presents
an automated way of acquiring data labels which uses a highly accurate and
portable global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The proposed system is
discussed besides a revision of other label acquisitions techniques and a
problem description of manual data annotation. The article concludes with a
systematic comparison of conventional hand labeling and automatic data
acquisition. The results show clear advantages of the proposed method without a
relevant loss in labeling accuracy. Minor changes can be observed in the
measured radar data, but the so introduced bias of the GNSS reference is
clearly outweighed by the indisputable time savings. Beside data annotation,
the proposed system can also provide a ground truth for validating object
tracking or other automated driving system applications.
