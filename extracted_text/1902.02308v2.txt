Decentralized Flood Forecasting Using Deep Neural Networks

This article is a pre-print submitted to ArXiv. 9 1 0 Abstract-Predicting flood for any location at times of extreme 2 storms is a longstanding problem that has utmost importance n in emergency management. Conventional methods that aim to u predict water levels in streams use advanced hydrological models J still lack of giving accurate forecasts everywhere. This study aims to explore artificial deep neural networks' performance 1 on flood prediction. While providing models that can be used 2 in forecasting stream stage, this paper presents a dataset that ] focuses on the connectivity of data points on river networks. It also shows that neural networks can be very helpful in time-series Gforecasting as in flood events, and support improving existing .sLmoIdnedlesxthTreorumgsh-dnaetuaraals,sinmetilwaotirokns., flood, forecasting c [
