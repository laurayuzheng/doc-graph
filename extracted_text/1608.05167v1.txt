AID: A Benchmark Dataset for Performance Evaluation of Aerial Scene Classi cation

Aerial scene classi cation, which aims to automatically label an aerial image with a speci c semantic category, is a fundamental problem for understanding high-resolution remote sensing imagery. In recent years, it has become an active task in remote sensing area and numerous algorithms have been proposed for this task, including many machine learning and data-driven approaches. However, the existing datasets for aerial scene classi cation like UC-Merced dataset and WHU-RS19 are with relatively small sizes, and the results on them are already saturated. This largely limits the development of scene classi cation algorithms. This paper describes the Aerial Image Dataset (AID): a large-scale dataset for aerial scene classi cation. The goal of AID is to advance the state-of-the-arts in scene classi cation of remote sensing images. For creating AID, we collect and annotate more than ten thousands aerial scene images. In addition, a comprehensive review of the existing aerial scene classi cation techniques as well as recent widely-used deep learning methods is given. Finally, we provide a performance analysis of typical aerial scene classi cation and deep learning approaches on AID, which can be served as the baseline results on this benchmark.
