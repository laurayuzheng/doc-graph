BreizhCrops: A Satellite Time Series Dataset for Crop Type
  Identification
  This dataset challenges the time series community with the task of
satellite-based vegetation identification on large scale real-world dataset of
satellite data acquired during one entire year. It consists of time series data
with associated crop types from 580k field parcels in Brittany, France (Breizh
in local language). Along with this dataset, we provide results and code of a
Long Short-Term Memory network and Transformer network as baselines. We release
dataset, along with preprocessing scripts and baseline models in
https://github.com/TUM-LMF/BreizhCrops and encourage methodical researchers to
benchmark and develop novel methods applied to satellite-based crop monitoring.
