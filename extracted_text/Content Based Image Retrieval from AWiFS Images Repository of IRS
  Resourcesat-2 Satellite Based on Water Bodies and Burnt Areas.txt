Content Based Image Retrieval from AWiFS Images Repository of IRS
  Resourcesat-2 Satellite Based on Water Bodies and Burnt Areas
  Satellite Remote Sensing Technology is becoming a major milestone in the
prediction of weather anomalies, natural disasters as well as finding
alternative resources in proximity using multiple multi-spectral sensors
emitting electromagnetic waves at distinct wavelengths. Hence, it is imperative
to extract water bodies and burnt areas from orthorectified tiles and
correspondingly rank them using similarity measures. Different objects in all
the spheres of the earth have the inherent capability of absorbing
electromagnetic waves of distant wavelengths. This creates various unique masks
in terms of reflectance on the receptor. We propose Dynamic Semantic
Segmentation (DSS) algorithms that utilized the mentioned capability to extract
and rank Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) images according to various
features. This system stores data intelligently in the form of a sparse feature
vector which drastically mitigates the computational and spatial costs incurred
for further analysis. The compressed source image is divided into chunks and
stored in the database for quicker retrieval. This work is intended to utilize
readily available and cost effective resources like AWiFS dataset instead of
depending on advanced technologies like Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for data which is scarce.
