Correcting biased observation model error in data assimilation
  While the formulation of most data assimilation schemes assumes an unbiased
observation model error, in real applications, model error with nontrivial
biases is unavoidable. A practical example is the error in the radiative
transfer model (which is used to assimilate satellite measurements) in the
presence of clouds. As a consequence, many (in fact 99\%) of the cloudy
observed measurements are not being used although they may contain useful
information. This paper presents a novel nonparametric Bayesian scheme which is
able to learn the observation model error distribution and correct the bias in
incoming observations. This scheme can be used in tandem with any data
assimilation forecasting system. The proposed model error estimator uses
nonparametric likelihood functions constructed with data-driven basis functions
based on the theory of kernel embeddings of conditional distributions developed
in the machine learning community. Numerically, we show positive results with
two examples. The first example is designed to produce a bimodality in the
observation model error (typical of "cloudy" observations) by introducing
obstructions to the observations which occur randomly in space and time. The
second example, which is physically more realistic, is to assimilate cloudy
satellite brightness temperature-like quantities, generated from a stochastic
cloud model for tropical convection and a simple radiative transfer model.
