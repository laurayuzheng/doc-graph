Structured Priors for Sparse-Representation-Based Hyperspectral Image Classification

-Pixel-wise classification, where each pixel is assigned to a predefined class, is one of the most important procedures in hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis. By representing a test pixel as 4 a linear combination of a small subset of labeled pixels, a sparse 1 representation classifier (SRC) gives rather plausible results 0 compared with that of traditional classifiers such as the support 2 vector machine (SVM). Recently, by incorporating additional n structured sparsity priors, the second generation SRCs have a appeared in the literature and are reported to further improve J the performance of HSI. These priors are based on exploiting 61 itnhheersepnattiasltrduecptuernedeonfcitehse bdeticwteioennartyh,e onreibgohtbho.riInng tphiixselps,aptehre,
