Earthquake catalog-based machine learning identification of laboratory
  fault states and the effects of magnitude of completeness
  Machine learning regression can predict macroscopic fault properties such as
shear stress, friction, and time to failure using continuous records of fault
zone acoustic emissions. Here we show that a similar approach is successful
using event catalogs derived from the continuous data. Our methods are
applicable to catalogs of arbitrary scale and magnitude of completeness. We
investigate how machine learning regression from an event catalog of laboratory
earthquakes performs as a function of the catalog magnitude of completeness. We
find that strong model performance requires a sufficiently low magnitude of
completeness, and below this magnitude of completeness model performance
saturates.
