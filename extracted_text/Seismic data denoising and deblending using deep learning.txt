Seismic data denoising and deblending using deep learning
  An important step of seismic data processing is removing noise, including
interference due to simultaneous and blended sources, from the recorded data.
Traditional methods are time-consuming to apply as they often require manual
choosing of parameters to obtain good results. We use deep learning, with a
U-net model incorporating a ResNet architecture pretrained on ImageNet and
further trained on synthetic seismic data, to perform this task. The method is
applied to common offset gathers, with adjacent offset gathers of the gather
being denoised provided as additional input channels. Here we show that this
approach leads to a method that removes noise from several datasets recorded in
different parts of the world with moderate success. We find that providing
three adjacent offset gathers on either side of the gather being denoised is
most effective. As this method does not require parameters to be chosen, it is
more automated than traditional methods.
