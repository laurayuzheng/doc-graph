Exemplar-based synthesis of geology using kernel discrepancies and
  generative neural networks
  We propose a framework for synthesis of geological images based on an
exemplar image. We synthesize new realizations such that the discrepancy in the
patch distribution between the realizations and the exemplar image is
minimized. Such discrepancy is quantified using a kernel method for two-sample
test called maximum mean discrepancy. To enable fast synthesis, we train a
generative neural network in an offline phase to sample realizations
efficiently during deployment, while also providing a parametrization of the
synthesis process. We assess the framework on a classical binary image
representing channelized subsurface reservoirs, finding that the method
reproduces the visual patterns and spatial statistics (image histogram and
two-point probability functions) of the exemplar image.
