Hypothesis Testing in Speckled Data with Stochastic Distances
  Images obtained with coherent illumination, as is the case of sonar,
ultrasound-B, laser and Synthetic Aperture Radar -- SAR, are affected by
speckle noise which reduces the ability to extract information from the data.
Specialized techniques are required to deal with such imagery, which has been
modeled by the G0 distribution and under which regions with different degrees
of roughness and mean brightness can be characterized by two parameters; a
third parameter, the number of looks, is related to the overall signal-to-noise
ratio. Assessing distances between samples is an important step in image
analysis; they provide grounds of the separability and, therefore, of the
performance of classification procedures. This work derives and compares eight
stochastic distances and assesses the performance of hypothesis tests that
employ them and maximum likelihood estimation. We conclude that tests based on
the triangular distance have the closest empirical size to the theoretical one,
while those based on the arithmetic-geometric distances have the best power.
Since the power of tests based on the triangular distance is close to optimum,
we conclude that the safest choice is using this distance for hypothesis
testing, even when compared with classical distances as Kullback-Leibler and
Bhattacharyya.
