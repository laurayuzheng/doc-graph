Identifying Solar Flare Precursors Using Time Series of SDO/HMI Images
  and SHARP Parameters
  We present several methods towards construction of precursors, which show
great promise towards early predictions, of solar flare events in this paper. A
data pre-processing pipeline is built to extract useful data from multiple
sources (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) and Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) to prepare
inputs for machine learning algorithms. Two classification models are
presented: classification of flares from quiet times for active regions and
classification of strong versus weak flare events. We adopt deep learning
algorithms to capture both the spatial and temporal information from HMI
magnetogram data. Effective feature extraction and feature selection with raw
magnetogram data using deep learning and statistical algorithms enable us to
train classification models to achieve almost as good performance as using
active region parameters provided in HMI/Space-Weather HMI-Active Region Patch
(SHARP) data files. The results show great promise towards accurate, reliable,
and timely predictions of solar flare events. The use of Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) data will be the topic of future studies.
