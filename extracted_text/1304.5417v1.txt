Analytic Expressions for Stochastic Distances Between Relaxed Complex Wishart Distributions

-The scaled complex Wishart distribution is a widely used model for multilook full polarimetric SAR data whose adequacy has been attested in the literature. 3 Classification, segmentation, and image analysis techniques 1 which depend on this model have been devised, and many 0 of them employ some type of dissimilarity measure. In this 2 paper we derive analytic expressions for four stochastic rp distances between relaxed scaled complex Wishart distributions in their most general form and in important Aparticular cases. Using these distances, inequalities are 9 obtained which lead to new ways of deriving the Bartlett 1 and revised Wishart distances. The expressiveness of the ] four analytic distances is assessed with respect to the Lvariation of parameters. Such distances are then used for deriving new tests statistics, which are proved to have .Masymptotic chi-square distribution. Adopting the test size t a as a comparison criterion, a sensitivity study is performed ts by means of Monte Carlo experiments suggesting that [ the Bhattacharyya statistic outperforms all the others. The power of the tests is also assessed. Applications to v1 actual data illustrate the discrimination and homogeneity 7 identification capabilities of these distances. 41 Index Terms-statistics, image analysis, information the5 ory, polarimetric radar, contrast measures. . 4
