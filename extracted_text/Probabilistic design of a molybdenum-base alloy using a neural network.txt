Probabilistic design of a molybdenum-base alloy using a neural network
  An artificial intelligence tool is exploited to discover and characterize a
new molybdenum-base alloy that is the most likely to simultaneously satisfy
targets of cost, phase stability, precipitate content, yield stress, and
hardness. Experimental testing demonstrates that the proposed alloy fulfils the
computational predictions, and furthermore the physical properties exceed those
of other commercially available Mo-base alloys for forging-die applications.
