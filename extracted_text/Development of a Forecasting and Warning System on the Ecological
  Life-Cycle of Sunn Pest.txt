Development of a Forecasting and Warning System on the Ecological
  Life-Cycle of Sunn Pest
  We provide a machine learning solution that replaces the traditional methods
for deciding the pesticide application time of Sunn Pest. We correlate climate
data with phases of Sunn Pest in its life-cycle and decide whether the fields
should be sprayed. Our solution includes two groups of prediction models. The
first group contains decision trees that predict migration time of Sunn Pest
from winter quarters to wheat fields. The second group contains random forest
models that predict the nymphal stage percentages of Sunn Pest which is a
criterion for pesticide application. We trained our models on four years of
climate data which was collected from Kir\c{s}ehir and Aksaray. The experiments
show that our promised solution make correct predictions with high accuracies.
