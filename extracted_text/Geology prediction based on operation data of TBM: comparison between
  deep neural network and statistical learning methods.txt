Geology prediction based on operation data of TBM: comparison between
  deep neural network and statistical learning methods
  Tunnel boring machine (TBM) is a complex engineering system widely used for
tunnel construction. In view of the complicated construction environments, it
is necessary to predict geology conditions prior to excavation. In recent
years, massive operation data of TBM has been recorded, and mining these data
can provide important references and useful information for designers and
operators of TBM. In this work, a geology prediction approach is proposed based
on deep neural network and operation data. It can provide relatively accurate
geology prediction results ahead of the tunnel face compared with the other
prediction models based on statistical learning methods. The application case
study on a tunnel in China shows that the proposed approach can accurately
estimate the geological conditions prior to excavation, especially for the
short range ahead of training data. This work can be regarded as a good
complement to the geophysical prospecting approach during the construction of
tunnels, and also highlights the applicability and potential of deep neural
networks for other data mining tasks of TBMs.
