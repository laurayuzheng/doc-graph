Assigning a Grade: Accurate Measurement of Road Quality Using Satellite
  Imagery
  Roads are critically important infrastructure to societal and economic
development, with huge investments made by governments every year. However,
methods for monitoring those investments tend to be time-consuming, laborious,
and expensive, placing them out of reach for many developing regions. In this
work, we develop a model for monitoring the quality of road infrastructure
using satellite imagery. For this task, we harness two trends: the increasing
availability of high-resolution, often-updated satellite imagery, and the
enormous improvement in speed and accuracy of convolutional neural
network-based methods for performing computer vision tasks. We employ a unique
dataset of road quality information on 7000km of roads in Kenya combined with
50cm resolution satellite imagery. We create models for a binary classification
task as well as a comprehensive 5-category classification task, with accuracy
scores of 88 and 73 percent respectively. We also provide evidence of the
robustness of our methods with challenging held-out scenarios, though we note
some improvement is still required for confident analysis of a never before
seen road. We believe these results are well-positioned to have substantial
impact on a broad set of transport applications.
