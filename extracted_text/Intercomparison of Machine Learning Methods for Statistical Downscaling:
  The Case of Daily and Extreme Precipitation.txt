Intercomparison of Machine Learning Methods for Statistical Downscaling:
  The Case of Daily and Extreme Precipitation
  Statistical downscaling of global climate models (GCMs) allows researchers to
study local climate change effects decades into the future. A wide range of
statistical models have been applied to downscaling GCMs but recent advances in
machine learning have not been explored. In this paper, we compare four
fundamental statistical methods, Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD),
Ordinary Least Squares, Elastic-Net, and Support Vector Machine, with three
more advanced machine learning methods, Multi-task Sparse Structure Learning
(MSSL), BCSD coupled with MSSL, and Convolutional Neural Networks to downscale
daily precipitation in the Northeast United States. Metrics to evaluate of each
method's ability to capture daily anomalies, large scale climate shifts, and
extremes are analyzed. We find that linear methods, led by BCSD, consistently
outperform non-linear approaches. The direct application of state-of-the-art
machine learning methods to statistical downscaling does not provide
improvements over simpler, longstanding approaches.
