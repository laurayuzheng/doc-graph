Deep Learning for Scientific Inference from Geophysical Data: The
  Madden-Julian Oscillation as a Test Case
  Deep learning can recognize complex geophysical phenomena by inferring which
variables are important for their identification and understanding their
spatial characteristics.
  We use a particular mode of multi-scale tropical atmospheric variability, the
Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), to study the capabilities of deep learning, a
form of artificial intelligence and machine learning, in identifying spatial
geophysical phenomena. The MJO is characterized by its spatial and temporal
evolution of cloud patterns, and an extensive body of literature has examined
its defining characteristics. By applying a convolutional neural network (CNN),
a type of deep learning model, to the task of identifying the state of the MJO,
we show that deep learning can correctly identify geophysical phenomena by
"learning" the variables and spatial patterns important to their evolution. In
a broader sense, these findings suggest that deep learning models are
interpretable and viable for scientific inference in geoscientific
applications.
