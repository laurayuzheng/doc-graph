The FLUXCOM ensemble of global land-atmosphere energy fluxes
  Although a key driver of Earth's climate system, global land-atmosphere
energy fluxes are poorly constrained. Here we use machine learning to merge
energy flux measurements from FLUXNET eddy covariance towers with remote
sensing and meteorological data to estimate net radiation, latent and sensible
heat and their uncertainties. The resulting FLUXCOM database comprises 147
global gridded products in two setups: (1) 0.0833${\deg}$ resolution using
MODIS remote sensing data (RS) and (2) 0.5${\deg}$ resolution using remote
sensing and meteorological data (RS+METEO). Within each setup we use a full
factorial design across machine learning methods, forcing datasets and energy
balance closure corrections. For RS and RS+METEO setups respectively, we
estimate 2001-2013 global (${\pm}$ 1 standard deviation) net radiation as
75.8${\pm}$1.4 ${W\ m^{-2}}$ and 77.6${\pm}$2 ${W\ m^{-2}}$, sensible heat as
33${\pm}$4 ${W\ m^{-2}}$ and 36${\pm}$5 ${W\ m^{-2}}$, and evapotranspiration
as 75.6${\pm}$10 ${\times}$ 10$^3$ ${km^3\ yr^{-1}}$ and 76${\pm}$6 ${\times}$
10$^3$ ${km^3\ yr^{-1}}$. FLUXCOM products are suitable to quantify global
land-atmosphere interactions and benchmark land surface model simulations.
