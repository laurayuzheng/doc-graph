A Machine Learns to Predict the Stability of Tightly Packed Planetary
  Systems
  The requirement that planetary systems be dynamically stable is often used to
vet new discoveries or set limits on unconstrained masses or orbital elements.
This is typically carried out via computationally expensive N-body simulations.
We show that characterizing the complicated and multi-dimensional stability
boundary of tightly packed systems is amenable to machine learning methods. We
find that training an XGBoost machine learning algorithm on physically
motivated features yields an accurate classifier of stability in packed
systems. On the stability timescale investigated ($10^7$ orbits), it is 3
orders of magnitude faster than direct N-body simulations. Optimized machine
learning classifiers for dynamical stability may thus prove useful across the
discipline, e.g., to characterize the exoplanet sample discovered by the
upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). This proof of concept
motivates investing computational resources to train algorithms capable of
predicting stability over longer timescales and over broader regions of phase
space.
