Wind Estimation Using Quadcopter Motion: A Machine Learning Approach
  In this article, we study the well known problem of wind estimation in
atmospheric turbulence using small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS). We present a
machine learning approach to wind velocity estimation based on quadcopter state
measurements without a wind sensor. We accomplish this by training a long
short-term memory (LSTM) neural network (NN) on roll and pitch angles and
quadcopter position inputs with forcing wind velocities as the targets. The
datasets are generated using a simulated quadcopter in turbulent wind fields.
The trained neural network is deployed to estimate the turbulent winds as
generated by the Dryden gust model as well as a realistic large eddy simulation
(LES) of a near-neutral atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over flat terrain. The
resulting NN predictions are compared to a wind triangle approach that uses
tilt angle as an approximation of airspeed. Results from this study indicate
that the LSTM-NN based approach predicts lower errors in both the mean and
variance of the local wind field as compared to the wind triangle approach. The
work reported in this article demonstrates the potential of machine learning
for sensor-less wind estimation and has strong implications to large-scale
low-altitude atmospheric sensing using sUAS for environmental and autonomous
navigation applications.
