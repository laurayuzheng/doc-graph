A mixture of experts model for predicting persistent weather patterns
  Weather and atmospheric patterns are often persistent. The simplest weather
forecasting method is the so-called persistence model, which assumes that the
future state of a system will be similar (or equal) to the present state.
Machine learning (ML) models are widely used in different weather forecasting
applications, but they need to be compared to the persistence model to analyse
whether they provide a competitive solution to the problem at hand. In this
paper, we devise a new model for predicting low-visibility in airports using
the concepts of mixture of experts. Visibility level is coded as two different
ordered categorical variables: cloud height and runway visual height. The
underlying system in this application is stagnant approximately in 90% of the
cases, and standard ML models fail to improve on the performance of the
persistence model. Because of this, instead of trying to simply beat the
persistence model using ML, we use this persistence as a baseline and learn an
ordinal neural network model that refines its results by focusing on learning
weather fluctuations. The results show that the proposal outperforms
persistence and other ordinal autoregressive models, especially for longer time
horizon predictions and for the runway visual height variable.
