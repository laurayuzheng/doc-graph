Biogeography based Satellite Image Classification
  Biogeography is the study of the geographical distribution of biological
organisms. The mindset of the engineer is that we can learn from nature.
Biogeography Based Optimization is a burgeoning nature inspired technique to
find the optimal solution of the problem. Satellite image classification is an
important task because it is the only way we can know about the land cover map
of inaccessible areas. Though satellite images have been classified in past by
using various techniques, the researchers are always finding alternative
strategies for satellite image classification so that they may be prepared to
select the most appropriate technique for the feature extraction task in hand.
This paper is focused on classification of the satellite image of a particular
land cover using the theory of Biogeography based Optimization. The original
BBO algorithm does not have the inbuilt property of clustering which is
required during image classification. Hence modifications have been proposed to
the original algorithm and the modified algorithm is used to classify the
satellite image of a given region. The results indicate that highly accurate
land cover features can be extracted effectively when the proposed algorithm is
used.
