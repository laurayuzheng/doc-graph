Evaluating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties of time series deep
  learning models for soil moisture predictions
  Soil moisture is an important variable that determines floods, vegetation
health, agriculture productivity, and land surface feedbacks to the atmosphere,
etc. Accurately modeling soil moisture has important implications in both
weather and climate models. The recently available satellite-based observations
give us a unique opportunity to build data-driven models to predict soil
moisture instead of using land surface models, but previously there was no
uncertainty estimate. We tested Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) with an aleatoric
term for our long short-term memory models for this problem, and asked if the
uncertainty terms behave as they were argued to. We show that the method
successfully captures the predictive error after tuning a hyperparameter on a
representative training dataset. We show the MCD uncertainty estimate, as
previously argued, does detect dissimilarity.
