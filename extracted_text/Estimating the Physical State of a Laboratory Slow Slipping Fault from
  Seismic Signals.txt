Estimating the Physical State of a Laboratory Slow Slipping Fault from
  Seismic Signals
  Over the last two decades, strain and GPS measurements have shown that slow
slip on earthquake faults is a widespread phenomenon. Slow slip is also
inferred from correlated small amplitude seismic signals known as nonvolcanic
tremor and low frequency earthquakes (LFEs). Slow slip has been reproduced in
laboratory and simulation studies, however the fundamental physics of these
phenomena and their relationship to dynamic earthquake rupture remains poorly
understood. Here we show that, in a laboratory setting, continuous seismic
waves are imprinted with fundamental signatures of the fault's physical state.
Using machine learning on continuous seismic waves, we can infer several bulk
characteristics of the fault (friction, shear displacement, gouge thickness),
at any time during the slow slip cycle. This analysis also allows us to infer
many properties of the future behavior of the fault, including the time
remaining before the next slow slip event. Our work suggests that by applying
machine learning approaches to continuous seismic data, new insight into the
physics of slow slip could be obtained in Earth.
