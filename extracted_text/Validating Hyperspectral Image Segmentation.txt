Validating Hyperspectral Image Segmentation
  Hyperspectral satellite imaging attracts enormous research attention in the
remote sensing community, hence automated approaches for precise segmentation
of such imagery are being rapidly developed. In this letter, we share our
observations on the strategy for validating hyperspectral image segmentation
algorithms currently followed in the literature, and show that it can lead to
over-optimistic experimental insights. We introduce a new routine for
generating segmentation benchmarks, and use it to elaborate ready-to-use
hyperspectral training-test data partitions. They can be utilized for fair
validation of new and existing algorithms without any training-test data
leakage.
