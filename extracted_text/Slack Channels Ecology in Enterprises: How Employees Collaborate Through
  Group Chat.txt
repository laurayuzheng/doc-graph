Slack Channels Ecology in Enterprises: How Employees Collaborate Through
  Group Chat
  Despite the long history of studying instant messaging usage in
organizations, we know very little about how today's people participate in
group chat channels and interact with others. In this short note, we aim to
update the existing knowledge on how group chat is used in the context of
today's organizations. We have the privilege of collecting a total of 4300
publicly available group chat channels in Slack from an R\&D department in a
multinational IT company. Through qualitative coding of 100 channels, we
identified 9 channel categories such as project based channels and event
channels. We further defined a feature metric with 21 features to depict the
group communication style for these group chat channels, with which we
successfully trained a machine learning model that can automatically classify a
given group channel into one of the 9 categories. In addition, we illustrated
how these communication metrics could be used for analyzing teams'
collaboration activities. We focused on 117 project teams as we have their
performance data, and further collected 54 out of the 117 teams' Slack group
data and generated the communication style metrics for each of them. With these
data, we are able to build a regression model to reveal the relationship
between these group communication styles and one indicator of the project team
performance.
