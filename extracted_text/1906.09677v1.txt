Remote Sensor Design for Visual Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks

-While deep learning technologies for computer vision have developed rapidly since 2012, modeling of remote sensing systems has remained focused around human vision. In particular, remote sensing systems are usually constructed to optimize sensing cost-quality trade-offs with respect to human image 9 interpretability. While some recent studies have explored remote 1 sensing system design as a function of simple computer vision 0 algorithm performance, there has been little work relating this 2 design to the state-of-the-art in computer vision: deep learning with convolutional neural networks. We develop experimental n systems to conduct this analysis, showing results with modern u deep learning algorithms and recent overhead image data. Our J results are compared to standard image quality measurements 4 based on human visual perception, and we conclude not only 2 that machine and human interpretability differ significantly, but that computer vision performance is largely self-consistent across ] a range of disparate conditions. This research is presented as a Vcornerstone for a new generation of sensor design systems which I focus on computer algorithm performance instead of human . s visual perception. s e Index Terms-Remote sensing, convolutional neural network e (CNN), deep learning, transfer learning, satellite imagery, image [ system design. 1
