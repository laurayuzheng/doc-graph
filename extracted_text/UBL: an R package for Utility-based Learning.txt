UBL: an R package for Utility-based Learning
  This document describes the R package UBL that allows the use of several
methods for handling utility-based learning problems. Classification and
regression problems that assume non-uniform costs and/or benefits pose serious
challenges to predictive analytic tasks. In the context of meteorology,
finance, medicine, ecology, among many other, specific domain information
concerning the preference bias of the users must be taken into account to
enhance the models predictive performance. To deal with this problem, a large
number of techniques was proposed by the research community for both
classification and regression tasks. The main goal of UBL package is to
facilitate the utility-based predictive analytic task by providing a set of
methods to deal with this type of problems in the R environment. It is a
versatile tool that provides mechanisms to handle both regression and
classification (binary and multiclass) tasks. Moreover, UBL package allows the
user to specify his domain preferences, but it also provides some automatic
methods that try to infer those preference bias from the domain, considering
some common known settings.
