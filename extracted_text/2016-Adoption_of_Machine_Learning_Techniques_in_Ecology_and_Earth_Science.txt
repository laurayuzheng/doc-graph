Adoption of Machine Learning Techniques in Ecology and Earth Science

Background
The natural sciences, such as ecology and earth science, study complex interactions
between biotic and abiotic systems in order to understand and make predictions.
Machinelearning-based methods have an advantage over traditional statistical methods in studying
these systems because the former do not impose unrealistic assumptions (such as
linearity), are capable of inferring missing data, and can reduce long-term expert
annotation burden. Thus, a wider adoption of machine learning methods in ecology and
earth science has the potential to greatly accelerate the pace and quality of science.
Despite these advantages, the full potential of machine learning techniques in ecology and
earth science has not be fully realized.
