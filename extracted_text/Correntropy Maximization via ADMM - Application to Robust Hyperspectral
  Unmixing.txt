Correntropy Maximization via ADMM - Application to Robust Hyperspectral
  Unmixing
  In hyperspectral images, some spectral bands suffer from low signal-to-noise
ratio due to noisy acquisition and atmospheric effects, thus requiring robust
techniques for the unmixing problem. This paper presents a robust supervised
spectral unmixing approach for hyperspectral images. The robustness is achieved
by writing the unmixing problem as the maximization of the correntropy
criterion subject to the most commonly used constraints. Two unmixing problems
are derived: the first problem considers the fully-constrained unmixing, with
both the non-negativity and sum-to-one constraints, while the second one deals
with the non-negativity and the sparsity-promoting of the abundances. The
corresponding optimization problems are solved efficiently using an alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach. Experiments on synthetic and
real hyperspectral images validate the performance of the proposed algorithms
for different scenarios, demonstrating that the correntropy-based unmixing is
robust to outlier bands.
