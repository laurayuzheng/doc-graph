FLARECAST: an I4.0 technology for space weather using satellite data
  'Flare Likelihood and Region Eruption Forecasting (FLARECAST)' is a Horizon
2020 project, which realized a technological platform for machine learning
algorithms, with the objective of providing the space weather community with a
prediction service for solar flares. This paper describes the FLARECAST service
and shows how the methods implemented in the platform allow both flare
prediction and a quantitative assessment of how the information contained in
the space data utilized in the analysis may impact the forecasting process.
