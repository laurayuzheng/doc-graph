Learning Argo Profiles by using the Signature Method
  A profile from the Argo ocean observing array is a sequence of
three-dimensional vectors composed of pressure, salinity, and temperature,
appearing as a continuous curve in three-dimensional space.The shape of such
curve is faithfully represented by a path signature, a collection of all the
iterated integrals. Moreover, the product of two terms of the signature of a
path can be expressed as a sum of higher order terms. Thanks to this algebraic
property,a nonlinear function of profile shape can always be represented by a
weighted linear combination of the iterated integrals,which makes easy to
perform machine learning of a complicated function of the profile shape. In
this study, we perform a supervised learning of existing Argo data with quality
control flags using the signature method, and demonstrate the prediction skill
by cross-validation. This technique should be a key to realizing an automatic
quality control of the Argo profile data.
