Satellite Image Forgery Detection and Localization Using GAN and
  One-Class Classifier
  Current satellite imaging technology enables shooting high-resolution
pictures of the ground. As any other kind of digital images, overhead pictures
can also be easily forged. However, common image forensic techniques are often
developed for consumer camera images, which strongly differ in their nature
from satellite ones (e.g., compression schemes, post-processing, sensors,
etc.). Therefore, many accurate state-of-the-art forensic algorithms are bound
to fail if blindly applied to overhead image analysis. Development of novel
forensic tools for satellite images is paramount to assess their authenticity
and integrity. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for satellite image
forgery detection and localization. Specifically, we consider the scenario in
which pixels within a region of a satellite image are replaced to add or remove
an object from the scene. Our algorithm works under the assumption that no
forged images are available for training. Using a generative adversarial
network (GAN), we learn a feature representation of pristine satellite images.
A one-class support vector machine (SVM) is trained on these features to
determine their distribution. Finally, image forgeries are detected as
anomalies. The proposed algorithm is validated against different kinds of
satellite images containing forgeries of different size and shape.
