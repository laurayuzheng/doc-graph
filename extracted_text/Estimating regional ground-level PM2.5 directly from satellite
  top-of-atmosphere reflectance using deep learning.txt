Estimating regional ground-level PM2.5 directly from satellite
  top-of-atmosphere reflectance using deep learning
  Almost all remote sensing atmospheric PM2.5 estimation methods need satellite
aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, which are often retrieved from
top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance via an atmospheric radiative transfer
model. Then, is it possible to estimate ground-level PM2.5 directly from
satellite TOA reflectance without a physical model? In this study, this
challenging work are achieved based on a machine learning model. Specifically,
we establish the relationship between PM2.5, satellite TOA reflectance,
observation angles, and meteorological factors in a deep learning architecture
(denoted as Ref-PM modeling). Taking the Wuhan Urban Agglomeration (WUA) as a
case study, the results demonstrate that compared with the AOD-PM modeling, the
Ref-PM modeling obtains a competitive performance, with out-of-sample
cross-validated R2 and RMSE values of 0.87 and 9.89 ug/m3 respectively. Also,
the TOA-reflectance-derived PM2.5 have a finer resolution and larger spatial
coverage than the AOD-derived PM2.5. This work updates the traditional
cognition of remote sensing PM2.5 estimation and has the potential to promote
the application in atmospheric environmental monitoring.
