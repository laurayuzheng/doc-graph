Digital Ecosystems: Optimisation by a Distributed Intelligence
  Can intelligence optimise Digital Ecosystems? How could a distributed
intelligence interact with the ecosystem dynamics? Can the software components
that are part of genetic selection be intelligent in themselves, as in an
adaptive technology? We consider the effect of a distributed intelligence
mechanism on the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of our Digital Ecosystem,
which is the digital counterpart of a biological ecosystem for evolving
software services in a distributed network. We investigate Neural Networks and
Support Vector Machine for the learning based pattern recognition functionality
of our distributed intelligence. Simulation results imply that the Digital
Ecosystem performs better with the application of a distributed intelligence,
marginally more effectively when powered by Support Vector Machine than Neural
Networks, and suggest that it can contribute to optimising the operation of our
Digital Ecosystem.
