Generating Realistic Geology Conditioned on Physical Measurements with
  Generative Adversarial Networks
  An important problem in geostatistics is to build models of the subsurface of
the Earth given physical measurements at sparse spatial locations. Typically,
this is done using spatial interpolation methods or by reproducing patterns
from a reference image. However, these algorithms fail to produce realistic
patterns and do not exhibit the wide range of uncertainty inherent in the
prediction of geology. In this paper, we show how semantic inpainting with
Generative Adversarial Networks can be used to generate varied realizations of
geology which honor physical measurements while matching the expected
geological patterns. In contrast to other algorithms, our method scales well
with the number of data points and mimics a distribution of patterns as opposed
to a single pattern or image. The generated conditional samples are state of
the art.
