A step towards procedural terrain generation with GANs
  Procedural terrain generation for video games has been traditionally been
done with smartly designed but handcrafted algorithms that generate heightmaps.
We propose a first step toward the learning and synthesis of these using recent
advances in deep generative modelling with openly available satellite imagery
from NASA.
