Matrix Completion With Variational Graph Autoencoders: Application in
  Hyperlocal Air Quality Inference
  Inferring air quality from a limited number of observations is an essential
task for monitoring and controlling air pollution. Existing inference methods
typically use low spatial resolution data collected by fixed monitoring
stations and infer the concentration of air pollutants using additional types
of data, e.g., meteorological and traffic information. In this work, we focus
on street-level air quality inference by utilizing data collected by mobile
stations. We formulate air quality inference in this setting as a graph-based
matrix completion problem and propose a novel variational model based on graph
convolutional autoencoders. Our model captures effectively the spatio-temporal
correlation of the measurements and does not depend on the availability of
additional information apart from the street-network topology. Experiments on a
real air quality dataset, collected with mobile stations, shows that the
proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
