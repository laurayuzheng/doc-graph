Combining Spatial and Telemetric Features for Learning Animal Movement
  Models
  We introduce a new graphical model for tracking radio-tagged animals and
learning their movement patterns. The model provides a principled way to
combine radio telemetry data with an arbitrary set of userdefined, spatial
features. We describe an efficient stochastic gradient algorithm for fitting
model parameters to data and demonstrate its effectiveness via asymptotic
analysis and synthetic experiments. We also apply our model to real datasets,
and show that it outperforms the most popular radio telemetry software package
used in ecology. We conclude that integration of different data sources under a
single statistical framework, coupled with appropriate parameter and state
estimation procedures, produces both accurate location estimates and an
interpretable statistical model of animal movement.
