Forecasting Drought Using Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural
  Network Model
  These days human beings are facing many environmental challenges due to
frequently occurring drought hazards. It may have an effect on the countrys
environment, the community, and industries. Several adverse impacts of drought
hazard are continued in Pakistan, including other hazards. However, early
measurement and detection of drought can provide guidance to water resources
management for employing drought mitigation policies. In this paper, we used a
multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) algorithm for drought forecasting.
We applied and tested MLPNN algorithm on monthly time series data of
Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for seventeen
climatological stations located in Northern Area and KPK (Pakistan). We found
that MLPNN has potential capability for SPEI drought forecasting based on
performance measures (i.e., Mean Average Error (MAE), the coefficient of
correlation R, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Water resources and
management planner can take necessary action in advance (e.g., in water
scarcity areas) by using MLPNN model as part of their decision making.
