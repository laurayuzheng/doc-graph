Detecting Comma-shaped Clouds for Severe Weather Forecasting using Shape
  and Motion
  Meteorologists use shapes and movements of clouds in satellite images as
indicators of several major types of severe storms. Satellite imaginary data
are in increasingly higher resolution, both spatially and temporally, making it
impossible for humans to fully leverage the data in their forecast. Automatic
satellite imagery analysis methods that can find storm-related cloud patterns
as soon as they are detectable are in demand. We propose a machine learning and
pattern recognition based approach to detect "comma-shaped" clouds in satellite
images, which are specific cloud distribution patterns strongly associated with
the cyclone formulation. In order to detect regions with the targeted movement
patterns, our method is trained on manually annotated cloud examples
represented by both shape and motion-sensitive features. Sliding windows in
different scales are used to ensure that dense clouds will be captured, and we
implement effective selection rules to shrink the region of interest among
these sliding windows. Finally, we evaluate the method on a hold-out annotated
comma-shaped cloud dataset and cross-match the results with recorded storm
events in the severe weather database. The validated utility and accuracy of
our method suggest a high potential for assisting meteorologists in weather
forecasting.
