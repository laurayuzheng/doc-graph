Integration of LiDAR and multispectral images for exposure and
  earthquake vulnerability estimation. Application in Lorca, Spain
  We present a procedure for assessing the urban exposure and seismic
vulnerability that integrates LiDAR data with aerial and satellite images. It
comprises three phases: first, we segment the satellite image to divide the
study area into different urban patterns. Second, we extract building
footprints and attributes that represent the type of building of each urban
pattern. Finally, we assign the seismic vulnerability to each building using
different machine-learning techniques: Decision trees, SVM, logistic regression
and Bayesian networks. We apply the procedure to 826 buildings in the city of
Lorca (SE Spain), where we count on a vulnerability database that we use as
ground truth for the validation of results. The outcomes show that the machine
learning techniques have similar performance, yielding vulnerability
classification results with an accuracy of 77% - 80% (F1-Score). The procedure
is scalable and can be replicated in different areas. It is especially
interesting as a complement to conventional data gathering approaches for
disaster risk applications in areas where field surveys need to be restricted
to certain areas, dates or budget. Keywords LiDAR, satellite image, orthophoto,
