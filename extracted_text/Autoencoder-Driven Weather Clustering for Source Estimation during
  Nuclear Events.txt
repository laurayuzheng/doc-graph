Autoencoder-Driven Weather Clustering for Source Estimation during
  Nuclear Events
  Emergency response applications for nuclear or radiological events can be
significantly improved via deep feature learning due to the hidden complexity
of the data and models involved. In this paper we present a novel methodology
for rapid source estimation during radiological releases based on deep feature
extraction and weather clustering. Atmospheric dispersions are then calculated
based on identified predominant weather patterns and are matched against
simulated incidents indicated by radiation readings on the ground. We evaluate
the accuracy of our methods over multiple years of weather reanalysis data in
the European region. We juxtapose these results with deep classification
convolution networks and discuss advantages and disadvantages.
