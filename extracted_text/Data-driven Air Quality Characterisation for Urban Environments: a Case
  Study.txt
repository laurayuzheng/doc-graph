Data-driven Air Quality Characterisation for Urban Environments: a Case
  Study
  The economic and social impact of poor air quality in towns and cities is
increasingly being recognised, together with the need for effective ways of
creating awareness of real-time air quality levels and their impact on human
health. With local authority maintained monitoring stations being
geographically sparse and the resultant datasets also featuring missing labels,
computational data-driven mechanisms are needed to address the data sparsity
challenge. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method to
accurately predict the Air Quality Index (AQI), using environmental monitoring
data together with meteorological measurements. To do so, we develop an air
quality estimation framework that implements a neural network that is enhanced
with a novel Non-linear Autoregressive neural network with exogenous input
(NARX), especially designed for time series prediction. The framework is
applied to a case study featuring different monitoring sites in London, with
comparisons against other standard machine-learning based predictive algorithms
showing the feasibility and robust performance of the proposed method for
different kinds of areas within an urban region.
