Spatial Patterns of Wind Speed Distributions in Switzerland
  This paper presents an initial exploration of high frequency records of
extreme wind speed in two steps. The first consists in finding the suitable
extreme distribution for $120$ measuring stations in Switzerland, by comparing
three known distributions: Weibull, Gamma, and Generalized extreme value. This
comparison serves as a basis for the second step which applies a spatial
modelling by using Extreme Learning Machine. The aim is to model distribution
parameters by employing a high dimensional input space of topographical
information. The knowledge of probability distribution gives a comprehensive
information and a global overview of wind phenomena. Through this study, a
flexible and a simple modelling approach is presented, which can be generalized
to almost extreme environmental data for risk assessment and to model renewable
energy.
