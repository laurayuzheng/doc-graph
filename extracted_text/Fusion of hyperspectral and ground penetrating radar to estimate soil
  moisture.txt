Fusion of hyperspectral and ground penetrating radar to estimate soil
  moisture
  In this contribution, we investigate the potential of hyperspectral data
combined with either simulated ground penetrating radar (GPR) or simulated
(sensor-like) soil-moisture data to estimate soil moisture. We propose two
simulation approaches to extend a given multi-sensor dataset which contains
sparse GPR data. In the first approach, simulated GPR data is generated either
by an interpolation along the time axis or by a machine learning model. The
second approach includes the simulation of soil-moisture along the GPR profile.
The soil-moisture estimation is improved significantly by the fusion of
hyperspectral and GPR data. In contrast, the combination of simulated,
sensor-like soil-moisture values and hyperspectral data achieves the worst
regression performance. In conclusion, the estimation of soil moisture with
hyperspectral and GPR data engages further investigations.
