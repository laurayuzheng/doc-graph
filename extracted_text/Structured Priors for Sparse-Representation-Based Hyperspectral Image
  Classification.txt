Recurrent Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series with Missing
  Values
  Multivariate time series data in practical applications, such as health care,
geoscience, and biology, are characterized by a variety of missing values. In
time series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing
values and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels,
a.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the
missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance.
In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of
the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a
state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of
missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates
them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term
temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to
achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification
tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and
provides useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing
values in time series analysis.
