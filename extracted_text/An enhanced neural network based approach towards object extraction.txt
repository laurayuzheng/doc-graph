An enhanced neural network based approach towards object extraction
  The improvements in spectral and spatial resolution of the satellite images
have facilitated the automatic extraction and identification of the features
from satellite images and aerial photographs. An automatic object extraction
method is presented for extracting and identifying the various objects from
satellite images and the accuracy of the system is verified with regard to IRS
satellite images. The system is based on neural network and simulates the
process of visual interpretation from remote sensing images and hence increases
the efficiency of image analysis. This approach obtains the basic
characteristics of the various features and the performance is enhanced by the
automatic learning approach, intelligent interpretation, and intelligent
interpolation. The major advantage of the method is its simplicity and that the
system identifies the features not only based on pixel value but also based on
the shape, haralick features etc of the objects. Further the system allows
flexibility for identifying the features within the same category based on size
and shape. The successful application of the system verified its effectiveness
and the accuracy of the system were assessed by ground truth verification.
