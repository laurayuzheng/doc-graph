Evolving Spatially Aggregated Features from Satellite Imagery for
  Regional Modeling
  Satellite imagery and remote sensing provide explanatory variables at
relatively high resolutions for modeling geospatial phenomena, yet regional
summaries are often desirable for analysis and actionable insight. In this
paper, we propose a novel method of inducing spatial aggregations as a
component of the machine learning process, yielding regional model features
whose construction is driven by model prediction performance rather than prior
assumptions. Our results demonstrate that Genetic Programming is particularly
well suited to this type of feature construction because it can automatically
synthesize appropriate aggregations, as well as better incorporate them into
predictive models compared to other regression methods we tested. In our
experiments we consider a specific problem instance and real-world dataset
relevant to predicting snow properties in high-mountain Asia.
