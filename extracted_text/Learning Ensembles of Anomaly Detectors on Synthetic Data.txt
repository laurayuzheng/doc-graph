Learning Ensembles of Anomaly Detectors on Synthetic Data
  The main aim of this work is to develop and implement an automatic anomaly
detection algorithm for meteorological time-series. To achieve this goal we
develop an approach to constructing an ensemble of anomaly detectors in
combination with adaptive threshold selection based on artificially generated
anomalies. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method by integrating
the corresponding implementation into ``Minimax-94'' road weather information
system.
