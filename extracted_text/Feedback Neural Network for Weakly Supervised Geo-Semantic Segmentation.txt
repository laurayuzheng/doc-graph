Feedback Neural Network for Weakly Supervised Geo-Semantic Segmentation
  Learning from weakly-supervised data is one of the main challenges in machine
learning and computer vision, especially for tasks such as image semantic
segmentation where labeling is extremely expensive and subjective. In this
paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture to perform
weakly-supervised learning by suppressing irrelevant neuron activations. It
localizes objects of interest by learning from image-level categorical labels
in an end-to-end manner. We apply this algorithm to a practical challenge of
transforming satellite images into a map of settlements and individual
buildings. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves
superior performance and efficiency when compared with various baseline models.
