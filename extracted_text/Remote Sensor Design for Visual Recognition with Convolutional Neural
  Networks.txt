Remote Sensor Design for Visual Recognition with Convolutional Neural
  Networks
  While deep learning technologies for computer vision have developed rapidly
since 2012, modeling of remote sensing systems has remained focused around
human vision. In particular, remote sensing systems are usually constructed to
optimize sensing cost-quality trade-offs with respect to human image
interpretability. While some recent studies have explored remote sensing system
design as a function of simple computer vision algorithm performance, there has
been little work relating this design to the state-of-the-art in computer
vision: deep learning with convolutional neural networks. We develop
experimental systems to conduct this analysis, showing results with modern deep
learning algorithms and recent overhead image data. Our results are compared to
standard image quality measurements based on human visual perception, and we
conclude not only that machine and human interpretability differ significantly,
but that computer vision performance is largely self-consistent across a range
of disparate conditions. This research is presented as a cornerstone for a new
generation of sensor design systems which focus on computer algorithm
performance instead of human visual perception.
