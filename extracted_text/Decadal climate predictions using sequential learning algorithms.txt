Decadal climate predictions using sequential learning algorithms
  Ensembles of climate models are commonly used to improve climate predictions
and assess the uncertainties associated with them. Weighting the models
according to their performances holds the promise of further improving their
predictions. Here, we use an ensemble of decadal climate predictions to
demonstrate the ability of sequential learning algorithms (SLAs) to reduce the
forecast errors and reduce the uncertainties. Three different SLAs are
considered, and their performances are compared with those of an equally
weighted ensemble, a linear regression and the climatology. Predictions of four
different variables--the surface temperature, the zonal and meridional wind,
and pressure--are considered. The spatial distributions of the performances are
presented, and the statistical significance of the improvements achieved by the
SLAs is tested. Based on the performances of the SLAs, we propose one to be
highly suitable for the improvement of decadal climate predictions.
