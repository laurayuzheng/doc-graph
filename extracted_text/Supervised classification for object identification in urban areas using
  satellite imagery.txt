Supervised classification for object identification in urban areas using
  satellite imagery
  This paper presents a useful method to achieve classification in satellite
imagery. The approach is based on pixel level study employing various features
such as correlation, homogeneity, energy and contrast. In this study gray-scale
images are used for training the classification model. For supervised
classification, two classification techniques are employed namely the Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and the Naive Bayes. With textural features used for
gray-scale images, Naive Bayes performs better with an overall accuracy of 76%
compared to 68% achieved by SVM. The computational time is evaluated while
performing the experiment with two different window sizes i.e., 50x50 and
70x70. The required computational time on a single image is found to be 27
seconds for a window size of 70x70 and 45 seconds for a window size of 50x50.
