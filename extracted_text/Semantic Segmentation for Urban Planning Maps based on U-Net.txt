Semantic Segmentation for Urban Planning Maps based on U-Net
  The automatic digitizing of paper maps is a significant and challenging task
for both academia and industry. As an important procedure of map digitizing,
the semantic segmentation section mainly relies on manual visual interpretation
with low efficiency. In this study, we select urban planning maps as a
representative sample and investigate the feasibility of utilizing U-shape
fully convolutional based architecture to perform end-to-end map semantic
segmentation. The experimental results obtained from the test area in Shibuya
district, Tokyo, demonstrate that our proposed method could achieve a very high
Jaccard similarity coefficient of 93.63% and an overall accuracy of 99.36%. For
implementation on GPGPU and cuDNN, the required processing time for the whole
Shibuya district can be less than three minutes. The results indicate the
proposed method can serve as a viable tool for urban planning map semantic
segmentation task with high accuracy and efficiency.
