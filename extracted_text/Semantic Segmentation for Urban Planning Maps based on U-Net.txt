Band Selection from Hyperspectral Images Using Attention-based
  Convolutional Neural Networks
  This paper introduces new attention-based convolutional neural networks for
selecting bands from hyperspectral images. The proposed approach re-uses
convolutional activations at different depths, identifying the most informative
regions of the spectrum with the help of gating mechanisms. Our attention
techniques are modular and easy to implement, and they can be seamlessly
trained end-to-end using gradient descent. Our rigorous experiments showed that
deep models equipped with the attention mechanism deliver high-quality
classification, and repeatedly identify significant bands in the training data,
permitting the creation of refined and extremely compact sets that retain the
most meaningful features.
