Combining machine learning techniques, microanalyses and large
  geochemical datasets for tephrochronological studies in complex volcanic
  areas: new age constraints for the Pleistocene magmatism of Central Italy
  Characterization, correlation and provenance determination of tephra samples
in sedimentary sections (tephrochronological studies) are powerful tools for
establishing ages of depositional events, volcanic eruptions, and tephra
dispersion. Despite the large literature and the advancements in this research
field, the univocal attribution of tephra deposits to specific volcanic sources
remains too often elusive. In this contribution, we test the application of a
machine learning technique named Support Vector Machine to attempt shedding new
light upon tephra deposits related to one of the most complex and debated
volcanic regions on Earth: the Pliocene-Pleistocene magmatism in Italy. The
machine learning algorithm was trained using one of the most comprehensive
global petrological databases (GEOROC); 17 chemical elements including major
and selected trace elements were chosen as input parameters. We first show the
ability of support vector machines in discriminating among different
Pliocene-Pleistocene volcanic provinces in Italy and then apply the same
methodology to determine the volcanic source of tephra samples occurring in the
Caio outcrop, an Early Pleistocene sedimentary section located in Central
Italy.
