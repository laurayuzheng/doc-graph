New approach for solar tracking systems based on computer vision, low
  cost hardware and deep learning
  In this work, a new approach for Sun tracking systems is presented. Due to
the current system limitations regarding costs and operational problems, a new
approach based on low cost, computer vision open hardware and deep learning has
been developed. The preliminary tests carried out successfully in Plataforma
solar de Almeria (PSA), reveal the great potential and show the new approach as
a good alternative to traditional systems. The proposed approach can provide
key variables for the Sun tracking system control like cloud movements
prediction, block and shadow detection, atmospheric attenuation or measures of
concentrated solar radiation, which can improve the control strategies of the
system and therefore the system performance.
