A Machine Learning Approach to Forecasting Remotely Sensed Vegetation
  Health
  Drought threatens food and water security around the world, and this threat
is likely to become more severe under climate change. High resolution
predictive information can help farmers, water managers, and others to manage
the effects of drought. We have created an open source tool to produce
short-term forecasts of vegetation health at high spatial resolution, using
data that are global in coverage. The tool automates downloading and processing
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets, and training
gradient-boosted machine models on hundreds of millions of observations to
predict future values of the Enhanced Vegetation Index. We compared the
predictive power of different sets of variables (raw spectral MODIS data and
Level-3 MODIS products) in two regions with distinct agro-ecological systems,
climates, and cloud coverage: Sri Lanka and California. Our tool provides
considerably greater predictive power on held-out datasets than simpler
baseline models.
