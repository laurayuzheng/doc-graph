Towards Identification of Relevant Variables in the observed Aerosol
  Optical Depth Bias between MODIS and AERONET observations
  Measurements made by satellite remote sensing, Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and globally distributed Aerosol Robotic Network
(AERONET) are compared. Comparison of the two datasets measurements for aerosol
optical depth values show that there are biases between the two data products.
In this paper, we present a general framework towards identifying relevant set
of variables responsible for the observed bias. We present a general framework
to identify the possible factors influencing the bias, which might be
associated with the measurement conditions such as the solar and sensor zenith
angles, the solar and sensor azimuth, scattering angles, and surface
reflectivity at the various measured wavelengths, etc. Specifically, we
performed analysis for remote sensing Aqua-Land data set, and used machine
learning technique, neural network in this case, to perform multivariate
regression between the ground-truth and the training data sets. Finally, we
used mutual information between the observed and the predicted values as the
measure of similarity to identify the most relevant set of variables. The
search is brute force method as we have to consider all possible combinations.
The computations involves a huge number crunching exercise, and we implemented
it by writing a job-parallel program.
