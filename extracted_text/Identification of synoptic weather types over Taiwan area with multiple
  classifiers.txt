Identification of synoptic weather types over Taiwan area with multiple
  classifiers
  In this study, a novel machine learning approach was used to classify three
types of synoptic weather events in Taiwan area from 2001 to 2010. We used
reanalysis data with three machine learning algorithms to recognize weather
systems and evaluated their performance. Overall, the classifiers successfully
identified 52-83% of weather events (hit rate), which is higher than the
performance of traditional objective methods. The results showed that the
machine learning approach gave low false alarm rate in general, while the
support vector machine (SVM) with more principal components of reanalysis data
had higher hit rate on all tested weather events. The sensitivity tests of grid
data resolution indicated that the differences between the high- and
low-resolution datasets are limited, which implied that the proposed method can
achieve reasonable performance in weather forecasting with minimal resources.
By identifying daily weather systems in historical reanalysis data, this method
can be used to study long-term weather changes, to monitor climatological-scale
variations, and to provide a better estimate of climate projections.
Furthermore, this method can also serve as an alternative to model output
statistics and potentially be used for synoptic weather forecasting.
