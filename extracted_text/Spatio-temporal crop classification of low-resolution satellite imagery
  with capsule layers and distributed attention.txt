Spatio-temporal crop classification of low-resolution satellite imagery
  with capsule layers and distributed attention
  Land use classification of low resolution spatial imagery is one of the most
extensively researched fields in remote sensing. Despite significant
advancements in satellite technology, high resolution imagery lacks global
coverage and can be prohibitively expensive to procure for extended time
periods. Accurately classifying land use change without high resolution imagery
offers the potential to monitor vital aspects of global development agenda
including climate smart agriculture, drought resistant crops, and sustainable
land management. Utilizing a combination of capsule layers and long-short term
memory layers with distributed attention, the present paper achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on temporal crop type classification at a 30x30m
resolution with Sentinel 2 imagery.
