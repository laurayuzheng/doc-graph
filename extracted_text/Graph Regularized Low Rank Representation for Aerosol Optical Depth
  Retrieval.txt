Graph Regularized Low Rank Representation for Aerosol Optical Depth
  Retrieval
  In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven regression model for aerosol
optical depth (AOD) retrieval. First, we adopt a low rank representation (LRR)
model to learn a powerful representation of the spectral response. Then, graph
regularization is incorporated into the LRR model to capture the local
structure information and the nonlinear property of the remote-sensing data.
Since it is easy to acquire the rich satellite-retrieval results, we use them
as a baseline to construct the graph. Finally, the learned feature
representation is feeded into support vector machine (SVM) to retrieve AOD.
Experiments are conducted on two widely used data sets acquired by different
sensors, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve
superior performance compared to the physical models and other state-of-the-art
empirical models.
