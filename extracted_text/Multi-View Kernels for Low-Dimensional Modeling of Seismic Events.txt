Multi-View Kernels for Low-Dimensional Modeling of Seismic Events
  The problem of learning from seismic recordings has been studied for years.
There is a growing interest in developing automatic mechanisms for identifying
the properties of a seismic event. One main motivation is the ability have a
reliable identification of man-made explosions. The availability of multiple
high-dimensional observations has increased the use of machine learning
techniques in a variety of fields. In this work, we propose to use a
kernel-fusion based dimensionality reduction framework for generating
meaningful seismic representations from raw data. The proposed method is tested
on 2023 events that were recorded in Israel and in Jordan. The method achieves
promising results in classification of event type as well as in estimating the
location of the event. The proposed fusion and dimensionality reduction tools
may be applied to other types of geophysical data.
