A Deep Neural Network to identify foreshocks in real time
  Foreshock events provide valuable insight to predict imminent major
earthquakes. However, it is difficult to identify them in real time. In this
paper, I propose an algorithm based on deep learning to instantaneously
classify a seismic waveform as a foreshock, mainshock or an aftershock event
achieving a high accuracy of 99% in classification. As a result, this is by far
the most reliable method to predict major earthquakes that are preceded by
foreshocks. In addition, I discuss methods to create an earthquake dataset that
is compatible with deep networks.
