Evaluating Compositionality in Sentence Embeddings
  An important challenge for human-like AI is compositional semantics. Recent
research has attempted to address this by using deep neural networks to learn
vector space embeddings of sentences, which then serve as input to other tasks.
We present a new dataset for one such task, `natural language inference' (NLI),
that cannot be solved using only word-level knowledge and requires some
compositionality. We find that the performance of state of the art sentence
embeddings (InferSent; Conneau et al., 2017) on our new dataset is poor. We
analyze the decision rules learned by InferSent and find that they are
consistent with simple heuristics that are ecologically valid in its training
dataset. Further, we find that augmenting training with our dataset improves
test performance on our dataset without loss of performance on the original
training dataset. This highlights the importance of structured datasets in
better understanding and improving AI systems.
