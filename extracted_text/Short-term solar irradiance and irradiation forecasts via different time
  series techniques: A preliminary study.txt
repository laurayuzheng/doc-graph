Short-term solar irradiance and irradiation forecasts via different time
  series techniques: A preliminary study
  This communication is devoted to solar irradiance and irradiation short-term
forecasts, which are useful for electricity production. Several different time
series approaches are employed. Our results and the corresponding numerical
simulations show that techniques which do not need a large amount of historical
data behave better than those which need them, especially when those data are
quite noisy.
