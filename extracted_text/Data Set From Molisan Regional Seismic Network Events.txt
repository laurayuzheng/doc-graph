Data Set From Molisan Regional Seismic Network Events
  After the earthquake occurred in Molise (Central Italy) on 31st October 2002
(Ml 5.4, 29 people dead), the local Servizio Regionale per la Protezione Civile
to ensure a better analysis of local seismic data, through a convention with
the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV), promoted the design
of the Regional Seismic Network (RMSM) and funded its implementation. The 5
stations of RMSM worked since 2007 to 2013 collecting a large amount of seismic
data and giving an important contribution to the study of seismic sources
present in the region and the surrounding territory. This work reports about
the dataset containing all triggers collected by RMSM since July 2007 to March
2009, including actual seismic events; among them, all earthquakes events
recorded in coincidence to Rete Sismica Nazionale Centralizzata (RSNC) of INGV
have been marked with S and P arrival timestamps. Every trigger has been
associated to a spectrogram defined into a recorded time vs. frequency domain.
The main aim of this structured dataset is to be used for further analysis with
data mining and machine learning techniques on image patterns associated to the
waveforms.
