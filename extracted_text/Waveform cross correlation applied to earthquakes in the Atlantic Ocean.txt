Waveform cross correlation applied to earthquakes in the Atlantic Ocean
  We assess the level of cross correlation between P-waves generated by
earthquakes in the Atlantic Ocean and measured by 22 array stations of the
International Monitoring System (IMS). There are 931 events with 6,411 arrivals
in 2011 and 2012. Station TORD was the most sensitive and detected 868 from 931
events. We constructed several 931 by 931 matrices of cross correlation
coefficients (CCs) for individual stations and also for average and cumulative
CCs. These matrices characterize the detection performance of the involved
stations and the IMS. Sixty earthquakes located in the northern hemisphere were
selected as master events for signal detection and building of events
populating a cross correlation Standard Event List (XSEL) for the first halves
of 2009 and 2012. High-quality signals (SNR>5.0) recorded by 10 most sensitive
stations were used as waveform templates. In order to quantitatively estimate
the gain in the completeness and resolution of the XSEL we compared it with the
Reviewed Event Bulletin (REB) of the International Data Centre (IDC) for the
North Atlantic (NA) and with the ISC Bulletin. Machine learning and
classification algorithms were successfully applied to automatically reject
invalid events in the XSEL for 2009.
