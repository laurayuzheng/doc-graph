Deep learning tutorial for denoising
  We herein introduce deep learning to seismic noise attenuation. Compared with
traditional seismic noise attenuation algorithms that depend on signal models
and their corresponding prior assumptions, a deep neural network is trained
based on a large training set, where the inputs are the raw datasets and the
corresponding outputs are the desired clean data. After the completion of
training, the deep learning method achieves adaptive denoising with no
requirements of (i) accurate modeling of the signal and noise, and (ii) optimal
parameters tuning. We call this intelligent denoising. We use a convolutional
neural network as the basic tool for deep learning. The training set is
generated with manually added noise in random and linear noise attenuation, and
with the wave equation in the multiple attenuation. Stochastic gradient descent
is used to solve the optimal parameters for the convolutional neural network.
The runtime of deep learning on a graphics processing unit for denoising has
the same order as the $f-x$ deconvolutional method. Synthetic and field results
show the potential applications of deep learning in the automation of random
noise attenuation with unknown variance, linear noise, and multiples.
