Mapping Informal Settlements in Developing Countries with
  Multi-resolution, Multi-spectral Data
  Detecting and mapping informal settlements encompasses several of the United
Nations sustainable development goals. This is because informal settlements are
home to the most socially and economically vulnerable people on the planet.
Thus, understanding where these settlements are is of paramount importance to
both government and non-government organizations (NGOs), such as the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), who can use this information to deliver
effective social and economic aid. We propose two effective methods for
detecting and mapping the locations of informal settlements. One uses only
low-resolution (LR), freely available, Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite
imagery with noisy annotations, whilst the other is a deep learning approach
that uses only costly very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. To our
knowledge, we are the first to map informal settlements successfully with
low-resolution satellite imagery. We extensively evaluate and compare the
proposed methods. Please find additional material at
