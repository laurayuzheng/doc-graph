PBBFMM3D: a Parallel Black-Box Fast Multipole Method for Non-oscillatory
  Kernels
  This paper presents PBBFMM3D: a parallel black-box fast multipole method that
accelerates kernel matrix-vector multiplications where the kernel is a
non-oscillatory function in three dimensions. Such problems arise from a wide
range of fields, \emph{e.g.,} computational mechanics, geosciences and machine
learning. While a naive direct evaluation has an $O(N^2)$ complexity in time
and storage, which is prohibitive for large-scale applications, PBBFMM3D
reduces the costs to $O(N)$. In contrast to other fast methods that require the
knowledge of the explicit kernel formula, PBBFMM3D requires only the ability to
evaluate the kernel. To further accelerate the computation on shared-memory
machines, the parallelism in PBBFMM3D was analyzed and implemented using
OpenMP. We show numerical experiments on the accuracy and the parallel
scalability of PBBFMM3D, as well as its applications to covariance matrix
computations that are heavily used in parameter estimation techniques, such as
kriging and Kalman filtering.
