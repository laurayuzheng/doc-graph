Three dimensional Deep Learning approach for remote sensing image
  classification
  Recently, a variety of approaches has been enriching the field of Remote
Sensing (RS) image processing and analysis. Unfortunately, existing methods
remain limited faced to the rich spatio-spectral content of today's large
datasets. It would seem intriguing to resort to Deep Learning (DL) based
approaches at this stage with regards to their ability to offer accurate
semantic interpretation of the data. However, the specificity introduced by the
coexistence of spectral and spatial content in the RS datasets widens the scope
of the challenges presented to adapt DL methods to these contexts. Therefore,
the aim of this paper is firstly to explore the performance of DL architectures
for the RS hyperspectral dataset classification and secondly to introduce a new
three-dimensional DL approach that enables a joint spectral and spatial
information process. A set of three-dimensional schemes is proposed and
evaluated. Experimental results based on well knownhyperspectral datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve a better classification
rate than state of the art methods with lower computational costs.
