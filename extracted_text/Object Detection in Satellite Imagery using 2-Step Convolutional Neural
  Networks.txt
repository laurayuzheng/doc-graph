Object Detection in Satellite Imagery using 2-Step Convolutional Neural
  Networks
  This paper presents an efficient object detection method from satellite
imagery. Among a number of machine learning algorithms, we proposed a
combination of two convolutional neural networks (CNN) aimed at high precision
and high recall, respectively. We validated our models using golf courses as
target objects. The proposed deep learning method demonstrated higher accuracy
than previous object identification methods.
