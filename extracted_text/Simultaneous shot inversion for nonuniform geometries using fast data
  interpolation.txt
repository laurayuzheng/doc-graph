Simultaneous shot inversion for nonuniform geometries using fast data
  interpolation
  Stochastic optimization is key to efficient inversion in PDE-constrained
optimization. Using 'simultaneous shots', or random superposition of source
terms, works very well in simple acquisition geometries where all sources see
all receivers, but this rarely occurs in practice. We develop an approach that
interpolates data to an ideal acquisition geometry while solving the inverse
problem using simultaneous shots. The approach is formulated as a joint inverse
problem, combining ideas from low-rank interpolation with full-waveform
inversion. Results using synthetic experiments illustrate the flexibility and
efficiency of the approach.
