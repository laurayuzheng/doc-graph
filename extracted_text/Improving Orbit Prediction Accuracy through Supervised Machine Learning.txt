Improving Orbit Prediction Accuracy through Supervised Machine Learning
  Due to the lack of information such as the space environment condition and
resident space objects' (RSOs') body characteristics, current orbit predictions
that are solely grounded on physics-based models may fail to achieve required
accuracy for collision avoidance and have led to satellite collisions already.
This paper presents a methodology to predict RSOs' trajectories with higher
accuracy than that of the current methods. Inspired by the machine learning
(ML) theory through which the models are learned based on large amounts of
observed data and the prediction is conducted without explicitly modeling space
objects and space environment, the proposed ML approach integrates
physics-based orbit prediction algorithms with a learning-based process that
focuses on reducing the prediction errors. Using a simulation-based space
catalog environment as the test bed, the paper demonstrates three types of
generalization capability for the proposed ML approach: 1) the ML model can be
used to improve the same RSO's orbit information that is not available during
the learning process but shares the same time interval as the training data; 2)
the ML model can be used to improve predictions of the same RSO at future
epochs; and 3) the ML model based on a RSO can be applied to other RSOs that
share some common features.
