Characterizing Evaporation Ducts Within the Marine Atmospheric Boundary
  Layer Using Artificial Neural Networks
  We apply a multilayer perceptron machine learning (ML) regression approach to
infer electromagnetic (EM) duct heights within the marine atmospheric boundary
layer (MABL) using sparsely sampled EM propagation data obtained within a
bistatic context. This paper explains the rational behind the selection of the
ML network architecture, along with other model hyperparameters, in an effort
to demystify the process of arriving at a useful ML model. The resulting speed
of our ML predictions of EM duct heights, using sparse data measurements within
MABL, indicates the suitability of the proposed method for real-time
applications.
