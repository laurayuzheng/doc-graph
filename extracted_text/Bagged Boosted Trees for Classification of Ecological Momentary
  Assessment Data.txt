Bagged Boosted Trees for Classification of Ecological Momentary
  Assessment Data
  Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data is organized in multiple levels
(per-subject, per-day, etc.) and this particular structure should be taken into
account in machine learning algorithms used in EMA like decision trees and its
variants. We propose a new algorithm called BBT (standing for Bagged Boosted
Trees) that is enhanced by a over/under sampling method and can provide better
estimates for the conditional class probability function. Experimental results
on a real-world dataset show that BBT can benefit EMA data classification and
performance.
