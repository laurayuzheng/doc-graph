Ensemble model aggregation using a computationally lightweight
  machine-learning model to forecast ocean waves
  This study investigated an approach to improve the accuracy of
computationally lightweight surrogate models by updating forecasts based on
historical accuracy relative to sparse observation data. Using a lightweight,
ocean-wave forecasting model, we created a large number of model ensembles,
with perturbed inputs, for a two-year study period. Forecasts were aggregated
using a machine-learning algorithm that combined forecasts from multiple,
independent models into a single 'best-estimate' prediction of the true state,
based on historical performance relative to observations. The framework was
applied to a case-study site in Monterey Bay, California.
A~learning-aggregation technique used historical observations and model
forecasts to calculate a weight for each ensemble member. Weighted ensemble
predictions were compared to measured wave conditions to evaluate performance
against present state-of-the-art. Finally, we discuss how this framework, which
integrates ensemble aggregations and surrogate models, can be used to improve
forecasting systems and scientific process studies.
