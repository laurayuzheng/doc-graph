A tunable multiresolution smoother for scattered data with application
  to particle filtering
  A smoothing algorithm is presented that can reduce the small-scale content of
data observed at scattered locations in a spatially extended domain. The
smoother works by forming a Gaussian interpolant of the input data, and then
convolving the interpolant with a multiresolution Gaussian approximation of the
Green's function to a differential operator whose spectrum can be tuned for
problem-specific considerations. This smoother is developed for its potential
application to particle filtering, which often involves data scattered over a
spatial domain, since preprocessing observations with a smoother reduces the
ensemble size required to avoid particle filter collapse. An example on
meteorological data verifies that our smoother improves the balance of particle
filter weights.
