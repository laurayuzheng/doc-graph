Meteorological time series forecasting based on MLP modelling using
  heterogeneous transfer functions
  In this paper, we propose to study four meteorological and seasonal time
series coupled with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modeling. We chose to
combine two transfer functions for the nodes of the hidden layer, and to use a
temporal indicator (time index as input) in order to take into account the
seasonal aspect of the studied time series. The results of the prediction
concern two years of measurements and the learning step, eight independent
years. We show that this methodology can improve the accuracy of meteorological
data estimation compared to a classical MLP modelling with a homogenous
transfer function.
