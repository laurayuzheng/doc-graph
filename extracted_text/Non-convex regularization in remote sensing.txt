Non-convex regularization in remote sensing
  In this paper, we study the effect of different regularizers and their
implications in high dimensional image classification and sparse linear
unmixing. Although kernelization or sparse methods are globally accepted
solutions for processing data in high dimensions, we present here a study on
the impact of the form of regularization used and its parametrization. We
consider regularization via traditional squared (2) and sparsity-promoting (1)
norms, as well as more unconventional nonconvex regularizers (p and Log Sum
Penalty). We compare their properties and advantages on several classification
and linear unmixing tasks and provide advices on the choice of the best
regularizer for the problem at hand. Finally, we also provide a fully
functional toolbox for the community.
