Learning the Representations of Moist Convection with Convolutional
  Neural Networks
  The representations of atmospheric moist convection in general circulation
models have been one of the most challenging tasks due to its complexity in
physical processes, and the interaction between processes under different
time/spatial scales. This study proposes a new method to predict the effects of
moist convection on the environment using convolutional neural networks. With
the help of considering the gradient of physical fields between adjacent grids
in the grey zone resolution, the effects of moist convection predicted by the
convolutional neural networks are more realistic compared to the effects
predicted by other machine learning models. The result also suggests that the
method proposed in this study has the potential to replace the conventional
cumulus parameterization in the general circulation models.
