Eigenvalues of random graphs with cycles
  Networks and graphs are often studied using the eigenvalues of their
adjacency matrix, an powerful mathematical tool with applications on fields as
diverse as systems engineering, ecology, machine learning and neuroscience. As
in those applications the exact graph structure is not known, researchers
resort to random graphs to obtain eigenvalue properties from known structural
features. However, this theory is not intuitive and only few results are known.
In this paper we tackle this problem through the cycles in a graph. We start by
deriving a simple relation between eigenvalues and cycle weights and we apply
it to two structural features: The spectral radius of circulant graphs and the
eigenvalue distribution of random graphs with motifs. During this study we
empirically uncover to surprising phenomena: First, circulant directed networks
have eigenvalues distributed in concentric circles around the origin. Second,
the eigenvalues of a network with abundance of short cycles are confined to the
interior of a $\tau$-ellipse --an ellipse with $\tau$ foci-- in the complex
plane, where $\tau$ is the length of the cycles. Our approach offers an
intuitive way to study eigenvalues on graphs and in doing so reveals surprising
connections between random matrix theory and planar geometry.
