Workflow-Driven Distributed Machine Learning in CHASE-CI: A Cognitive
  Hardware and Software Ecosystem Community Infrastructure
  The advances in data, computing and networking over the last two decades led
to a shift in many application domains that includes machine learning on big
data as a part of the scientific process, requiring new capabilities for
integrated and distributed hardware and software infrastructure. This paper
contributes a workflow-driven approach for dynamic data-driven application
development on top of a new kind of networked Cyberinfrastructure called
CHASE-CI. In particular, we present: 1) The architecture for CHASE-CI, a
network of distributed fast GPU appliances for machine learning and storage
managed through Kubernetes on the high-speed (10-100Gbps) Pacific Research
Platform (PRP); 2) A machine learning software containerization approach and
libraries required for turning such a network into a distributed computer for
big data analysis; 3) An atmospheric science case study that can only be made
scalable with an infrastructure like CHASE-CI; 4) Capabilities for virtual
cluster management for data communication and analysis in a dynamically
scalable fashion, and visualization across the network in specialized
visualization facilities in near real-time; and, 5) A step-by-step workflow and
performance measurement approach that enables taking advantage of the dynamic
architecture of the CHASE-CI network and container management infrastructure.
