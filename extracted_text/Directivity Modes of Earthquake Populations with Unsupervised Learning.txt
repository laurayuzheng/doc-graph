Directivity Modes of Earthquake Populations with Unsupervised Learning
  We present a novel approach for resolving modes of rupture directivity in
large populations of earthquakes. A seismic spectral decomposition technique is
used to first produce relative measurements of radiated energy for earthquakes
in a spatially-compact cluster. The azimuthal distribution of energy for each
earthquake is then assumed to result from one of several distinct modes of
rupture propagation. Rather than fitting a kinematic rupture model to determine
the most likely mode of rupture propagation, we instead treat the modes as
latent variables and learn them with a Gaussian mixture model. The mixture
model simultaneously determines the number of events that best identify with
each mode. The technique is demonstrated on four datasets in California with
several thousand earthquakes. We show that the datasets naturally decompose
into distinct rupture propagation modes that correspond to different rupture
directions, and the fault plane is unambiguously identified for all cases. We
find that these small earthquakes exhibit unilateral ruptures 53-74% of the
time on average. The results provide important observational constraints on the
physics of earthquakes and faults.
