Space Navigator: a Tool for the Optimization of Collision Avoidance
  Maneuvers
  The number of space objects will grow several times in a few years due to the
planned launches of constellations of thousands microsatellites. It leads to a
significant increase in the threat of satellite collisions. Spacecraft must
undertake collision avoidance maneuvers to mitigate the risk. According to
publicly available information, conjunction events are now manually handled by
operators on the Earth. The manual maneuver planning requires qualified
personnel and will be impractical for constellations of thousands satellites.
In this paper we propose a new modular autonomous collision avoidance system
called "Space Navigator". It is based on a novel maneuver optimization approach
that combines domain knowledge with Reinforcement Learning methods.
