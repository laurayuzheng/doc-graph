A Supervised Geometry-Aware Mapping Approach for Classification of
  Hyperspectral Images
  The lack of proper class discrimination among the Hyperspectral (HS) data
points poses a potential challenge in HS classification. To address this issue,
this paper proposes an optimal geometry-aware transformation for enhancing the
classification accuracy. The underlying idea of this method is to obtain a
linear projection matrix by solving a nonlinear objective function based on the
intrinsic geometrical structure of the data. The objective function is
constructed to quantify the discrimination between the points from dissimilar
classes on the projected data space. Then the obtained projection matrix is
used to linearly map the data to more discriminative space. The effectiveness
of the proposed transformation is illustrated with three benchmark real-world
HS data sets. The experiments reveal that the classification and dimensionality
reduction methods on the projected discriminative space outperform their
counterpart in the original space.
