Optimizing deep video representation to match brain activity
  The comparison of observed brain activity with the statistics generated by
artificial intelligence systems is useful to probe brain functional
organization under ecological conditions. Here we study fMRI activity in ten
subjects watching color natural movies and compute deep representations of
these movies with an architecture that relies on optical flow and image
content. The association of activity in visual areas with the different layers
of the deep architecture displays complexity-related contrasts across visual
areas and reveals a striking foveal/peripheral dichotomy.
