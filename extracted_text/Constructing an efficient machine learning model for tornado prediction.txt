Constructing an efficient machine learning model for tornado prediction
  Tornado prediction methods and main mechanisms of tornado genesis were
analyzed. A model, based on the superposition principle, has been built. For
efficiency evaluation, the constructed model has been tested on real-life data
obtained from the University of Oklahoma (USA). It is shown that the
constructed tornado prediction model is more efficient than all previous
models.
