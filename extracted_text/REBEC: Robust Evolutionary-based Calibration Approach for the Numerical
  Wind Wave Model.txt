REBEC: Robust Evolutionary-based Calibration Approach for the Numerical
  Wind Wave Model
  The adaptation of numerical wind wave models to the local time-spatial
conditions is a problem that can be solved by using various calibration
techniques. However, the obtained sets of physical parameters become over-tuned
to specific events if there is a lack of observations. In this paper, we
propose a robust evolutionary calibration approach that allows to build the
stochastic ensemble of perturbed models and use it to achieve the trade-off
between quality and robustness of the target model. The implemented robust
ensemble-based evolutionary calibration (REBEC) approach was compared to the
baseline SPEA2 algorithm in a set of experiments with the SWAN wind wave model
configuration for the Kara Sea domain. Provided metrics for the set of
scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the REBEC approach for the majority of
calibration scenarios.
