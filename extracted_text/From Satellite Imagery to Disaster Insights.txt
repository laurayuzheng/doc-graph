From Satellite Imagery to Disaster Insights
  The use of satellite imagery has become increasingly popular for disaster
monitoring and response. After a disaster, it is important to prioritize rescue
operations, disaster response and coordinate relief efforts. These have to be
carried out in a fast and efficient manner since resources are often limited in
disaster-affected areas and it's extremely important to identify the areas of
maximum damage. However, most of the existing disaster mapping efforts are
manual which is time-consuming and often leads to erroneous results. In order
to address these issues, we propose a framework for change detection using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on satellite images which can then be
thresholded and clustered together into grids to find areas which have been
most severely affected by a disaster. We also present a novel metric called
Disaster Impact Index (DII) and use it to quantify the impact of two natural
disasters - the Hurricane Harvey flood and the Santa Rosa fire. Our framework
achieves a top F1 score of 81.2% on the gridded flood dataset and 83.5% on the
gridded fire dataset.
