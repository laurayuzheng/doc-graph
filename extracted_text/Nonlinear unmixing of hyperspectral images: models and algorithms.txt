Analytic Expressions for Stochastic Distances Between Relaxed Complex
  Wishart Distributions
  The scaled complex Wishart distribution is a widely used model for multilook
full polarimetric SAR data whose adequacy has been attested in the literature.
Classification, segmentation, and image analysis techniques which depend on
this model have been devised, and many of them employ some type of
dissimilarity measure. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for four
stochastic distances between relaxed scaled complex Wishart distributions in
their most general form and in important particular cases. Using these
distances, inequalities are obtained which lead to new ways of deriving the
Bartlett and revised Wishart distances. The expressiveness of the four analytic
distances is assessed with respect to the variation of parameters. Such
distances are then used for deriving new tests statistics, which are proved to
have asymptotic chi-square distribution. Adopting the test size as a comparison
criterion, a sensitivity study is performed by means of Monte Carlo experiments
suggesting that the Bhattacharyya statistic outperforms all the others. The
power of the tests is also assessed. Applications to actual data illustrate the
discrimination and homogeneity identification capabilities of these distances.
