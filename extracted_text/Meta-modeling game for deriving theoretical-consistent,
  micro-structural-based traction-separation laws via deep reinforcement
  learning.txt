Meta-modeling game for deriving theoretical-consistent,
  micro-structural-based traction-separation laws via deep reinforcement
  learning
  This paper presents a new meta-modeling framework to employ deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate mechanical constitutive models for
interfaces. The constitutive models are conceptualized as information flow in
directed graphs. The process of writing constitutive models are simplified as a
sequence of forming graph edges with the goal of maximizing the model score (a
function of accuracy, robustness and forward prediction quality). Thus
meta-modeling can be formulated as a Markov decision process with well-defined
states, actions, rules, objective functions, and rewards. By using neural
networks to estimate policies and state values, the computer agent is able to
efficiently self-improve the constitutive model it generated through
self-playing, in the same way AlphaGo Zero (the algorithm that outplayed the
world champion in the game of Go)improves its gameplay. Our numerical examples
show that this automated meta-modeling framework not only produces models which
outperform existing cohesive models on benchmark traction-separation data but
is also capable of detecting hidden mechanisms among micro-structural features
and incorporating them in constitutive models to improve the forward prediction
accuracy, which are difficult tasks to do manually.
