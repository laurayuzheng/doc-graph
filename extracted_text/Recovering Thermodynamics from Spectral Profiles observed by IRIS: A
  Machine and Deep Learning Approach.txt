Recovering Thermodynamics from Spectral Profiles observed by IRIS: A
  Machine and Deep Learning Approach
  Inversion codes allow reconstructing a model atmosphere from observations.
With the inclusion of optically thick lines that form in the solar
chromosphere, such modelling is computationally very expensive because a
non-LTE evaluation of the radiation field is required. In this study, we
combine the results provided by these traditional methods with machine and deep
learning techniques to obtain similar-quality results in an easy-touse, much
faster way. We have applied these new methods to Mg II h&k lines observed by
IRIS. As a result, we are able to reconstruct the thermodynamic state
(temperature, line-of-sight velocity, non-thermal velocities, electron density,
etc.) in the chromosphere and upper photosphere of an area equivalent to an
active region in a few CPU minutes, speeding up the process by a factor of
$10^5$-$10^6$. The open-source code accompanying this paper will allow the
community to use IRIS observations to open a new window to a host of solar
phenomena.
