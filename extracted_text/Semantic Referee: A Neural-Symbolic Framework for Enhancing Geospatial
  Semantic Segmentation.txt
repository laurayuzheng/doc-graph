Semantic Referee: A Neural-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Geospatial
  Semantic Segmentation
  Understanding why machine learning algorithms may fail is usually the task of
the human expert that uses domain knowledge and contextual information to
discover systematic shortcomings in either the data or the algorithm. In this
paper, we propose a semantic referee, which is able to extract qualitative
features of the errors emerging from deep machine learning frameworks and
suggest corrections. The semantic referee relies on ontological reasoning about
spatial knowledge in order to characterize errors in terms of their spatial
relations with the environment. Using semantics, the reasoner interacts with
the learning algorithm as a supervisor. In this paper, the proposed method of
the interaction between a neural network classifier and a semantic referee
shows how to improve the performance of semantic segmentation for satellite
imagery data.
