Identifying Solar Flare Precursors Using Time Series of SDO/HMI Images and SHARP Parameters

We adopt deep learning algorithms that take time series of active regions as input, instead of using only stationary features at xed time points, to perform solar are classi cations (strong ares versus weak ares). Two sets of models are trained: classi cation of are versus non- are events, and classi cation of strong are events from weak are events. Our results represent a signi cant improvement over previous work on similar tasks. We use machine learning algorithms to extract features directly from magnetogram images. The extracted features can be used for prediction and classi cation purposes and have been shown to perform almost as well as when we use standard active region parameters that are calculated based on experts' knowledge about the physics behind solar are events, given by SHARP parameters. We build a thorough and exible data pre-processing pipeline to clean and prepare data (from GOES, SDO/JSOC) for the machine learning tasks. We demonstrate the e ectiveness of the proposed algorithms in identifying precursors for strong solar are events using out-of-sample prediction tasks: four representative active regions (tracked for more than 100 hours, with at least one strong are event) are chosen and tested to predict strong are events on tted classication models which are trained with other active regions. Our results show that we can construct precursors of solar are events e ciently using time series of SHARP parameters. This shows promising directions towards accurate online solar are predictions, which we will address in followup work. Furthermore, the physical meaning and interpretations of the modeling results are partially covered in this paper, more thorough investigations will follow.
