Identifying typical Mg II flare spectra using machine learning
  IRIS performs solar observations over a large range of atmospheric heights,
including the chromosphere where the majority of flare energy is dissipated.
The strong Mg II h&k spectral lines are capable of providing excellent
atmospheric diagnostics, but have not been fully utilized for flaring
atmospheres. We aim to investigate whether the physics of the chromosphere is
identical for all flare observations by analyzing if there are certain spectra
that occur in all flares. To achieve this, we automatically analyze hundreds of
thousands of Mg II h&k line profiles from a set of 33 flares, and use a machine
learning technique which we call supervised hierarchical k-means, to cluster
all profile shapes. We identify a single peaked Mg II profile, in contrast to
the double-peaked quiet Sun profiles, appearing in every flare. Additionally,
we find extremely broad profiles with characteristic blue shifted central
reversals appearing at the front of fast-moving flare ribbons. These profiles
occur during the impulsive phase of the flare, and we present results of their
temporal and spatial correlation with non-thermal hard X-ray signatures,
suggesting that flare-accelerated electrons play an important role in the
formation of these profiles. The ratio of the integrated Mg II h&k lines can
also serve as an opacity diagnostic, and we find higher opacities during each
flare maximum. Our study shows that machine learning is a powerful tool for
large scale statistical solar analyses.
