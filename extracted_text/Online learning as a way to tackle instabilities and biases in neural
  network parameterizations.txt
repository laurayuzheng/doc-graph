Online learning as a way to tackle instabilities and biases in neural
  network parameterizations
  Over the last couple of years, machine learning parameterizations have
emerged as a potential way to improve the representation of sub-grid processes
in atmospheric models. All previous studies created a training dataset from a
high-resolution simulation, fitted a machine learning algorithms to that
dataset, and then plugged the trained algorithm into an atmospheric model. The
resulting online simulations were frequently plagued by instabilities and
biases. Here, I propose online learning as a way to combat these issues. In
online learning, the pretrained machine learning parameterization, specifically
a neural network, is run in parallel with a high-resolution simulation which is
kept in sync with the neural network-driven atmospheric model through constant
forcing. This enables the neural network to learn from the tendencies that the
high-resolution simulation would produce if it experienced the atmospheric
states the neural network creates. The concept is illustrated using the Lorenz
96 model, where online learning is able to recover the "true"
parameterizations. Then I present detailed algorithms for implementing online
learning in the 3D cloud-resolving model and super-parameterization frameworks.
Finally, I discuss outstanding challenges and issues not solved by this
approach.
