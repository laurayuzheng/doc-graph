Generating a Training Dataset for Land Cover Classification to Advance
  Global Development
  Semantic segmentation of land cover classes is fundamental for agricultural
and economic development work, from sustainable forestry to urban planning, yet
existing training datasets have significant limitations. To generate an open
and comprehensive training library of high resolution Earth imagery and high
quality land cover classifications, public Sentinel-2 data at 10 m spatial
resolution was matched with accurate GlobeLand30 labels from 2010, which were
filtered by agreement with an intermediary Sentinel-2 classification at 20 m
produced during atmospheric correction. Scene-level classifications were
predicted by Random Forests trained on valid reflectance data and the filtered
labels, and achieved over 80% model accuracy for a variety of locations.
Further work is required to aggregate individual scene classifications for
annual labels and to test the approach in more locations, before crowdsourcing
human validation. The goal is to create a sustained community-wide effort to
generate image labels not only for land cover, but also very specific images
for major agriculture crops across the world and other thematic categories of
interest to the global development community.
