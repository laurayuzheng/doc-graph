Satellite imagery analysis for operational damage assessment in
  Emergency situations
  When major disaster occurs the questions are raised how to estimate the
damage in time to support the decision making process and relief efforts by
local authorities or humanitarian teams. In this paper we consider the use of
Machine Learning and Computer Vision on remote sensing imagery to improve time
efficiency of assessment of damaged buildings in disaster affected area. We
propose a general workflow that can be useful in various disaster management
applications, and demonstrate the use of the proposed workflow for the
assessment of the damage caused by the wildfires in California in 2017.
