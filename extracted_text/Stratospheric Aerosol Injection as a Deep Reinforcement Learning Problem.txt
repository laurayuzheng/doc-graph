Stratospheric Aerosol Injection as a Deep Reinforcement Learning Problem
  As global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the use of stratospheric
aerosol injection (SAI), a form of solar geoengineering, is increasingly
considered in order to artificially mitigate climate change effects. However,
initial research in simulation suggests that naive SAI can have catastrophic
regional consequences, which may induce serious geostrategic conflicts. Current
geo-engineering research treats SAI control in low-dimensional approximation
only. We suggest treating SAI as a high-dimensional control problem, with
policies trained according to a context-sensitive reward function within the
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) paradigm. In order to facilitate training in
simulation, we suggest to emulate HadCM3, a widely used General Circulation
Model, using deep learning techniques. We believe this is the first application
of DRL to the climate sciences.
