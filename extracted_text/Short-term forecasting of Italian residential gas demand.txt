Short-term forecasting of Italian residential gas demand
  Natural gas is the most important energy source in Italy: it fuels
thermoelectric power plants, industrial facilities and domestic heating. Gas
demand forecasting is a critical task for any energy provider as it impacts on
pipe reservation and stock planning. In this paper, the one-day-ahead
forecasting of Italian daily residential gas demand is studied. Five predictors
are developed and compared: Ridge Regression, Gaussian Process, k-Nearest
Neighbour, Artificial Neural Network, and Torus Model. Preprocessing and
feature selection are also discussed in detail. Concerning the prediction
error, a theoretical bound on the best achievable root mean square error is
worked out assuming ideal conditions, except for the inaccuracy of
meteorological temperature forecasts, whose effects are properly propagated.
The best predictors, namely the Artificial Neural Network and the Gaussian
Process, achieve an RMSE which is twice the performance limit, suggesting that
precise predictions of residential gas demand can be achieved at country level.
