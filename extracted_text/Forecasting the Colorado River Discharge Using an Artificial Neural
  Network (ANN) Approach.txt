Forecasting the Colorado River Discharge Using an Artificial Neural
  Network (ANN) Approach
  Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based model is a computational approach
commonly used for modeling the complex relationships between input and output
parameters. Prediction of the flow rate of a river is a requisite for any
successful water resource management and river basin planning. In the current
survey, the effectiveness of an Artificial Neural Network was examined to
predict the Colorado River discharge. In this modeling process, an ANN model
was used to relate the discharge of the Colorado River to such parameters as
the amount of precipitation, ambient temperature and snowpack level at a
specific time of the year. The model was able to precisely study the impact of
climatic parameters on the flow rate of the Colorado River.
