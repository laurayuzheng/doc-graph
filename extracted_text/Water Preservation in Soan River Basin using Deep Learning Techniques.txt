Water Preservation in Soan River Basin using Deep Learning Techniques
  Water supplies are crucial for the development of living beings. However,
change in the hydrological process i.e. climate and land usage are the key
issues. Sustaining water level and accurate estimating for dynamic conditions
is a critical job for hydrologists, but predicting hydrological extremes is an
open issue. In this paper, we proposed two deep learning techniques and three
machine learning algorithms to predict stream flow, given the present climate
conditions. The results showed that the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM), an artificial neural network based method, outperform
other conventional and machine-learning algorithms for predicting stream flow.
Furthermore, we analyzed that stream flow is directly affected by
precipitation, land usage, and temperature. These indexes are critical, which
can be used by hydrologists to identify the potential for stream flow. We make
the dataset publicly available (https://github.com/sadaqat007/Dataset) so that
others should be able to replicate and build upon the results published.
