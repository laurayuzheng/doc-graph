Earth System Modeling 2.0: A Blueprint for Models That Learn From
  Observations and Targeted High-Resolution Simulations
  Climate projections continue to be marred by large uncertainties, which
originate in processes that need to be parameterized, such as clouds,
convection, and ecosystems. But rapid progress is now within reach. New
computational tools and methods from data assimilation and machine learning
make it possible to integrate global observations and local high-resolution
simulations in an Earth system model (ESM) that systematically learns from
both. Here we propose a blueprint for such an ESM. We outline how
parameterization schemes can learn from global observations and targeted
high-resolution simulations, for example, of clouds and convection, through
matching low-order statistics between ESMs, observations, and high-resolution
simulations. We illustrate learning algorithms for ESMs with a simple dynamical
system that shares characteristics of the climate system; and we discuss the
opportunities the proposed framework presents and the challenges that remain to
realize it.
