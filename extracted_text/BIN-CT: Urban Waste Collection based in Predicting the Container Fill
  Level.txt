BIN-CT: Urban Waste Collection based in Predicting the Container Fill
  Level
  The fast demographic growth, together with the concentration of the
population in cities and the increasing amount of daily waste, are factors that
push to the limit the ability of waste assimilation by Nature. Therefore, we
need technological means to make an optimal management of the waste collection
process, which represents 70% of the operational cost in waste treatment. In
this article, we present a free intelligent software system, based on
computational learning algorithms, which plans the best routes for waste
collection supported by past (historical) and future (predictions) data.
  The objective of the system is the cost reduction of the waste collection
service by means of the minimization in distance traveled by any truck to
collect a container, hence the fuel consumption. At the same time the quality
of service to the citizen is increased avoiding the annoying overflows of
containers thanks to the accurate fill level predictions performed by BIN-CT.
In this article we show the features of our software system, illustrating it
operation with a real case study of a Spanish city. We conclude that the use of
BIN-CT avoids unnecessary visits to containers, reduces the distance traveled
to collect a container and therefore we obtain a reduction of total costs and
harmful emissions thrown to the atmosphere.
