Exploiting Capacity of Sewer System Using Unsupervised Learning
  Algorithms Combined with Dimensionality Reduction
  Exploiting capacity of sewer system using decentralized control is a cost
effective mean of minimizing the overflow. Given the size of the real sewer
system, exploiting all the installed control structures in the sewer pipes can
be challenging. This paper presents a divide and conquer solution to implement
decentralized control measures based on unsupervised learning algorithms. A
sewer system is first divided into a number of subcatchments. A series of
natural and built factors that have the impact on sewer system performance is
then collected. Clustering algorithms are then applied to grouping
subcatchments with similar hydraulic hydrologic characteristics. Following
which, principal component analysis is performed to interpret the main features
of sub-catchment groups and identify priority control locations. Overflows
under different control scenarios are compared based on the hydraulic model.
Simulation results indicate that priority control applied to the most suitable
cluster could bring the most profitable result.
