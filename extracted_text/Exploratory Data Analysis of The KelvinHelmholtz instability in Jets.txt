Exploratory Data Analysis of The KelvinHelmholtz instability in Jets
  The KelvinHelmholtz (KH) instability is a fundamental wave instability that
is frequently observed in all kinds of shear layer (jets, wakes, atmospheric
air currents etc). The study of KH-instability, coherent flow structures has a
major impact in understanding the fundamentals of fluid dynamics. Therefore
there is a need for methods that can identify and analyse these structures. In
this Final assignment, we use machine-learning methods such as Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to analyse
the coherent flow structures. We used a 2D co-axial jet as our data, with
Reynolds number corresponding to Re: 10,000. Results for POD modes and DMD
modes are discussed and compared.
