Can learning from natural image denoising be used for seismic data
  interpolation?
  We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) denoising based method for
seismic data interpolation. It provides a simple and efficient way to break
though the lack problem of geophysical training labels that are often required
by deep learning methods. The new method consists of two steps: (1) Train a set
of CNN denoisers from natural image clean-noisy pairs to learn denoising; (2)
Integrate the trained CNN denoisers into project onto convex set (POCS)
framework to perform seismic data interpolation. The method alleviates the
demanding of seismic big data with similar features as applications of
end-to-end deep learning on seismic data interpolation. Additionally, the
proposed method is flexible for many cases of traces missing because missing
cases are not involved in the training step, and thus it is of plug-and-play
nature. These indicate the high generalizability of our approach and the
reduction of the need of the problem-specific training. Primary results on
synthetic and field data show promising interpolation performances of the
presented CNN-POCS method in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, de-aliasing and
weak-feature reconstruction, in comparison with traditional $f$-$x$ prediction
filtering and curvelet transform based POCS methods.
